### [1] [An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549)
*Wendong Mao,Mingfan Zhao,Jianfeng Guan,Qiwei Dong,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件友好的优化框架，用于解决可变形注意力变换器（DAT）在硬件部署中的内存访问问题，通过NAS和切片策略优化，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAT在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其数据依赖的采样机制导致不规则内存访问模式，影响硬件部署效率。现有方法要么硬件开销高，要么牺牲模型精度。

Method: 提出基于神经架构搜索（NAS）的切片策略，自动划分输入特征为均匀块以避免内存冲突；设计FPGA验证系统测试性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，精度仅下降0.2%；在Xilinx FPGA上，DRAM访问次数减少至现有方法的18%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了硬件效率，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

### [2] [Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550)
*Hyeonseok Jin,Geonmin Kim,Kyungbaek Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DDCN的动态可变形卷积网络，用于高效且准确的时空交通预测，解决了传统方法在异质性和可扩展性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉交通数据的时空异质性，且图神经网络（GNNs）因复杂性和预定义邻接矩阵的限制，难以扩展到大尺度数据。

Method: DDCN通过动态应用基于偏移的可变形滤波器，分解为编码器-解码器结构，并在编码器中引入空间和时空注意力块以突出重要特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，DDCN具有竞争性的性能，验证了CNN方法在时空交通预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDCN通过动态可变形卷积和注意力机制，实现了高效且准确的交通预测，为CNN在时空数据中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

### [3] [Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554)
*Zejian Li,Yize Li,Chenye Meng,Zhongni Liu,Yang Ling,Shengyuan Zhang,Guang Yang,Changyuan Yang,Zhiyuan Yang,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Inversion-DPO的新对齐框架，通过DDIM反演优化扩散模型，无需奖励建模，显著提升训练效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法计算开销大且可能影响模型精度，因此需要一种更高效、高精度的对齐方法。

Method: 利用DDIM反演重新定义Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)，避免奖励建模，直接从样本反演到噪声。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和组合图像生成任务中表现优异，生成高保真且组合一致的图像。

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO为扩散模型提供了一种高效、高精度的对齐方法，适用于复杂生成任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

### [4] [Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558)
*Changlu Chen,Yanbin Liu,Chaoxi Niu,Ling Chen,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-VFM是一个新颖的框架，通过重新编程视觉基础模型（VFMs）来解决时空预测任务中的挑战，包括缺乏时间建模能力和视觉与时空数据的模态差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但在时空预测中面临时空相关性建模不足的问题。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过前后两个重新编程阶段处理数据。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线方法，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，适用于时空预测任务。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

### [5] [Expert Operational GANS: Towards Real-Color Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11562)
*Ozer Can Devecioglu,Serkan Kiranyaz,Mehmet Yamac,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: xOp-GAN是一种新型GAN模型，通过多个专家生成器网络解决水下图像恢复的异质性问题，每个生成器专注于特定质量范围的图像恢复，判别器根据感知置信度选择最佳恢复结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像恢复因复杂的光传播、散射和深度相关衰减导致的变形伪影而具有挑战性，传统单生成器GAN难以应对异质性领域。

Method: 提出xOp-GAN，包含多个专家生成器网络，每个生成器针对特定质量范围的图像进行训练，判别器在推理阶段选择最佳恢复结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单回归器模型，且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器结构和判别器的推理选择机制，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

### [6] [Data-Driven Meta-Analysis and Public-Dataset Evaluation for Sensor-Based Gait Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11571)
*Varun Velankar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过综合分析59项研究和大型实验，评估了基于步态估计年龄的方法，发现多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），并分析了步态特征与年龄的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态年龄估计在医疗、安全和人机交互中有重要应用，需建立性能基准和实用指南。

Method: 结合元分析、大型数据集实验（如OU-ISIR和VersatileGait）和可解释性技术（如Grad-CAM）。

Result: 多传感器融合误差为3.4年，深度网络准确率达96%，处理速度低于0.1秒/样本。

Conclusion: 通过综合方法，论文为实际场景中步态年龄误差降至3年以下提供了基准和指导。

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

*Victor Caquilpan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用改进的PPGNet模型（PPGNet-Cat）通过图像重识别技术监控野生猫对野生动物的影响，取得了高精度结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生猫对澳大利亚野生动物的危害极大，需要高效监控以减少其影响。

Method: 改进PPGNet模型（原用于东北虎重识别）为PPGNet-Cat，并探索对比学习方法如ArcFace损失。

Result: PPGNet-Cat表现优异，mAP达0.86，rank-1准确率为0.95。

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat在野生猫重识别领域具有竞争力。

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

*Sathvik Chereddy,John Femiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchDNN提出了一种生成CAD草图的模型，通过统一的连续-离散扩散过程联合建模连续参数和离散类别标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CAD草图中原始参数化的异质性和原始元素的排列不变性两大挑战。

Method: 采用Gaussian-Softmax扩散，通过高斯噪声扰动logit并通过softmax变换投影到概率单纯形上。

Result: 生成质量显著提升，FID从16.04降至7.80，NLL从84.8降至81.33。

Conclusion: 在SketchGraphs数据集上实现了CAD草图生成的最新最优性能。

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that
jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a
unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is
Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL)
from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch
generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

### [9] [Interpretable Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Rectal Cancer MRI Using Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11638)
*Benjamin Keel,Aaron Quyn,David Jayne,Maryam Mohsin,Samuel D. Relton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的特征编码模型，用于提高直肠癌淋巴结转移（LNM）分期的准确性，替代了现有方法中的大型预训练卷积神经网络（CNN）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于淋巴结大小、形状和纹理形态的放射学标准诊断准确性有限，而VAE通过重构图像直接编码视觉特征，生成的结构化潜在空间比CNN更具可解释性。

Method: 使用VAE作为特征编码器，结合多层感知机（MLP），在168名未接受新辅助治疗的患者的MRI数据集上进行训练和验证。

Result: 提出的VAE-MLP模型在MRI数据集上表现优异，交叉验证指标为AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05，敏感性0.79 +/- 0.06，特异性0.85 +/- 0.05。

Conclusion: VAE-MLP模型在淋巴结转移分期中实现了最先进的性能，证明了VAE在医学影像分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85
+/- 0.05. Code is available at:

*Abhishek Jaiswal,Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种基于姿势的心理状态推断方法，通过板球运动验证其有效性，用于识别攻击性和防守性击球意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 姿势推断在疲劳诊断、伤害预防和性能提升方面潜力巨大，但面临数据敏感性问题。体育场景为多样化情绪状态数据收集提供了可行替代方案。

Method: 通过运动分析从活动视频中识别人类意图，利用现有数据统计作为弱监督验证。

Result: 方法在区分攻击性和防守性击球意图上达到75% F1分数和80% AUC-ROC。

Conclusion: 姿势泄露了意图推断的强信号，研究为体育分析和跨领域人类行为分析提供了通用技术。

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

### [11] [VISTA: Monocular Segmentation-Based Mapping for Appearance and View-Invariant Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11653)
*Hannah Shafferman,Annika Thomas,Jouko Kinnari,Michael Ricard,Jose Nino,Jonathan How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一种基于分割和跟踪的单目全局定位框架，能在不同视角和季节变化下实现一致定位，无需特定领域训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无结构环境中全局定位的挑战，如视角变化、季节变化和遮挡。

Method: 结合前端对象分割与跟踪管道和子图对应搜索，利用几何一致性对齐参考帧。

Result: 在季节和斜角航空数据集上，召回率提升69%，地图大小仅为基线方法的0.6%。

Conclusion: VISTA在资源受限平台上实现实时全局定位，性能优于基线方法。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）与传统CNN-based OCR在户外广告文本识别中的表现，发现VLMs在场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外广告文本识别在复杂场景中仍具挑战性，传统OCR在噪声环境下表现不佳，而新兴的VLMs可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 系统评估了Qwen 2.5 VL 3B、InternVL3和SmolVLM2等VLMs与PaddleOCRv4在ICDAR 2015和SVT数据集上的表现，并加入合成天气噪声模拟真实场景。

Result: VLMs在整体场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: VLMs在复杂场景中有潜力，但CNN在特定任务中仍具优势，研究团队公开了天气增强的基准和评估代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

Motivation: 设计具有人类类似抽象视觉推理能力的智能系统是人工智能领域的长期目标，但现有深度AVR求解器通常需要任务特定设计或参数，增加了解决新任务的成本。

Method: 论文将一些知名AVR任务重新表述为目标图像在问题面板中的可预测性问题，并通过训练一个条件生成模型来解决多种AVR任务。

Conclusion: UCGS提供了一种统一的框架，能够高效解决多种AVR任务，降低了模型训练和调整的成本，同时展示了零样本推理的潜力。

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在密集对应点集中剔除异常点时，通常假设视觉域一致，忽视了多样场景结构带来的挑战。

Method: 采用去风格化双分支处理域偏移，通过风格混合减少域特定表征的负面影响；设计双融合专家混合模块，通过线性复杂度注意力和动态专家路由自适应整合多视角特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，CorrMoE在准确性和泛化性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CorrMoE通过创新的模块设计，显著提升了跨域和跨场景下的对应点修剪性能。

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用文本中的情感线索，且缺乏有效机制过滤与情感无关的面部动态。

Method: GRACE结合动态运动建模、语义文本细化（CATE模块）和基于熵正则化最优传输的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在模糊或不平衡情感类别场景中，达到新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: GRACE通过细粒度跨模态对齐和情感感知文本增强，显著提升了动态面部表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间频率调制（SFM）方法，通过调制高频特征以降低频率后再下采样，并在上采样时解调，有效减少混叠并保留细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息对语义分割精度至关重要，但下采样层会导致高频成分混叠或失真。

Method: 使用自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征，设计轻量级模块和多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）解调。

Result: 方法有效减少混叠并保留细节，适用于多种任务和架构。

Conclusion: SFM方法广泛适用且高效，可扩展至多种计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Motivation: 事件传感器在行人监测中表现优异，但相关数据稀缺，SEPose旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用CARLA模拟器和动态视觉传感器生成SEPose数据集，包含35万标注行人姿态关键点。

Result: 在SEPose上训练的RVT和YOLOv8模型展示了良好的模拟到现实的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SEPose为事件传感器在行人监测中的应用提供了宝贵的数据支持。

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

Motivation: 传统相机在低光环境下难以捕捉清晰多视角图像，事件相机的高动态范围和高速度特性可缓解此问题，但现有方法仍面临噪声和色调不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，采用三重监督学习和色调匹配模块，结合事件相机和3D高斯泼溅技术，重建低光环境下的明亮帧。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有方法，成功实现辐射场重建。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS是首个事件辅助的3D高斯泼溅框架，有效解决了低光环境下的多视角重建问题，并提供了首个真实捕获的数据集。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

Motivation: 当前基准主要评估被动视觉感知，缺乏对主动构建视觉模式以支持问题解决能力的评估。心理可视化是人类认知的核心能力，需填补这一研究空白。

Method: 设计Hyperphantasia基准，包含四个程序生成的谜题，分三个难度级别，评估MLLMs的心理可视化能力，并探索强化学习的改进潜力。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs在心理可视化能力上与人类存在显著差距，部分模型仅能识别视觉模式，但无法实现稳健的心理模拟。

Conclusion: 心理可视化是当前MLLMs的开放挑战，需进一步研究提升其视觉模拟能力。

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成多实例图像时难以处理实例间的关系差异和属性泄漏，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: RaDL通过可学习参数增强实例特定属性，并利用关系注意力生成关系感知图像特征。

Result: 在COCO-Position、COCO-MIG和DrawBench等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多属性考虑和实例关系方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是生成考虑实例关系和属性的多实例图像的有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在原型对齐、数据过拟合和样本权重分配上的不足。

Method: 定义OTP和VTP原型，采用渐进对齐策略和原型重加权机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PPAR有效提升了语义分割的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked

LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法在性能和效率之间难以平衡，要么调整文本提示开销大，要么手工视觉特征增强效果不稳定。

Method: 提出GS-Bias，通过全局偏置（捕捉全局语义）和空间偏置（学习区域语义一致性）直接添加到预训练模型的输出中，避免全反向传播。

Conclusion: GS-Bias在高效性和性能上均优于现有方法，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

Conclusion: EC-Diff有效平衡了生成质量与推理速度，为云边协作框架提供了优化方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

Result: 实验表明，MPAE能在复杂场景中鲁棒地发现与实际物体形状匹配的部件。

Conclusion: MPAE为无监督部件发现提供了一种有效范式，支持跨类别和场景的应用，并解决了遮挡和部件相似性等挑战。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

Conclusion: 该方法在保留单个风格保真度的同时，实现了用户引导的风格混合。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

Motivation: 当前Textual Inversion方法在保持面部身份一致性上存在语义对齐问题，ID-EA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ID-EA包含ID-Enhancer和ID-Adapter，前者整合身份嵌入与文本ID锚点，后者调整预训练UNet模型的交叉注意力模块。

Result: ID-EA在身份保持指标上显著优于现有方法，且计算效率高，生成速度快15倍。

Conclusion: ID-EA有效提升了身份一致性，同时保持了高效的计算性能。

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共遥感数据集因分辨率差异和地物类别定义不一致而缺乏普适性，需要利用大量未标注数据提升模型性能。

Method: SAMST结合监督模型自训练和SAM伪标签优化器，通过阈值过滤、提示生成和标签细化模块迭代优化伪标签。

Conclusion: SAMST通过结合大模型的泛化能力和小模型的训练效率，提升了伪标签准确性，为遥感语义分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了AUBlendSet数据集和AUBlendNet方法，用于基于面部动作单元（AUs）的细粒度3D面部表情操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D面部动画在细粒度风格化表情操纵方面存在挑战，主要因缺乏合适的数据集。

Method: 引入AUBlendSet数据集（基于32个标准AUs的500个身份数据），并提出AUBlendNet网络学习不同风格的AU-Blendshape基向量。

Result: 通过实验验证了AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet在表情操纵、语音驱动动画和情感识别数据增强中的有效性。

Conclusion: AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet填补了3D面部动画领域的空白，展示了其在多任务中的潜力。

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于电路理论的新型频率动态注意力调制（FDAM）方法，通过注意力反转和频率动态缩放技术，解决了ViTs中频率消失问题，提升了多种视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理，限制了性能。

Method: 提出FDAM，包含注意力反转（AttInv）和频率动态缩放（FreqScale），动态调整频率响应。

Result: 在多种模型（如SegFormer、DeiT）和任务（如语义分割、目标检测）中表现优异，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM有效解决了ViTs的频率消失问题，显著提升了性能，且易于集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文将掩码图像建模（MIM）重新定义为稀疏信号重建问题，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码增强域不变特征提取，无需预训练即可实现域自适应分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作仅将掩码视为图像变形形式，缺乏理论分析，未能充分利用掩码重建在特征提取中的潜力。

Method: 将掩码重建理论化为稀疏信号问题，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码一致性增强域不变特征学习。

Result: MaskTwins在自然和生物图像分割中优于基线方法，展示了提取域不变特征的显著优势。

Conclusion: MaskTwins为域自适应分割提供了新范式，无需预训练即可高效提取跨域特征。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

Motivation: 探索如何利用深度学习模型理解自然电影刺激下的大脑视觉处理机制，并重建对应的视觉输入。

Method: 采用时间卷积层处理连续的影片帧输入，以弥补自然电影刺激与fMRI采集之间的时间分辨率差距。

Result: 模型成功预测视觉皮层及其周围体素的活动，并重建视觉输入；显著贡献区域包括中枕区、梭状区和距状区。

Conclusion: 研究表明，深度学习模型可以作为理解视觉处理的工具，特别是对边缘、面孔和对比等特征的解码能力。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将RGB域视为统一域，忽略了其多子域（如白天、夜晚、雾天）的特性，解耦域不变和域特定特征有助于RGB-IR域适应。

Method: 设计了光谱自适应幂等解耦（SAID）模块，通过光谱分解解耦域不变和域特定特征；提出基于滤波器组的光谱处理范式和解耦损失；引入空间-光谱耦合方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了基线性能，并在多个RGB-IR数据集上优于现有方法，包括基于FLIR-ADAS数据集的新实验协议。

Conclusion: 通过解耦和耦合策略，SS-DC框架有效提升了RGB-IR域自适应目标检测的性能，为多子域场景提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

<details>

Motivation: 高质量开源数据集在推动深度学习发展的同时面临被滥用的风险，现有验证技术无法适用于掩码模型，亟需解决方案。

Method: 基于掩码信息重建难度的差异，设计DOV4MM方法验证模型是否在目标数据集上预训练。

Result: 在多个掩码图像和语言模型上验证，DOV4MM显著优于现有方法，p值远低于0.05。

Conclusion: DOV4MM为掩码模型的数据集所有权验证提供了有效解决方案，保护了数据集所有者的权益。

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture.

Abstract: With the growing need for diverse and scalable data in indoor scene tasks,

from ScanQA and ScanRefer, 3D-MoRe generates 62,000 question-answer (QA) pairs
and 73,000 object descriptions across 1,513 scenes. We also employ various data
augmentation techniques and implement semantic filtering to ensure high-quality
data. Experiments on ScanQA demonstrate that 3D-MoRe significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with the CIDEr score improving by 2.15\%.
Similarly, on ScanRefer, our approach achieves a notable increase in CIDEr@0.5
by 1.84\%, highlighting its effectiveness in both tasks. Our code and generated

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IICMVNCD是首个探索多视图新类发现的方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

Conclusion: SGLoc在无初始姿态先验的情况下展现出卓越的全局定位能力。

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

Result: 在多个域上超越现有最优模型，显著减少训练冗余。

Conclusion: InstructFLIP通过文本指导和指令解耦，有效提升了FAS系统的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

Motivation: 对抗攻击对基于人脸识别的身份验证系统构成严重威胁，现有方法依赖迭代优化或迁移性，效率低且不实用。

Method: 利用FRS特征空间中的属性子空间结构，生成视觉差异大但被识别为目标身份的对抗人脸，仅需单次非自适应查询。

Result: 在AWS CompareFaces API上达到93%以上的成功率，且能控制生成人脸的高级属性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，解决了现有对抗攻击的局限性，为FRS安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

Method: 使用小波变换将特征空间分解为低频分支（用于光照调整）和高频分支（用于纹理增强），并提出高频引导的跨视图交互模块（HF-CIM）和细节纹理增强模块（DTEM）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在光照调整和高频信息恢复方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过小波变换和特征空间解耦，有效提升了低光立体图像的增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Result: 在Argoverse和nuScenes数据集上表现出色，显著提升了预测置信度和性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模行为意图，结合IRL和分层解码器，实现了更准确和可解释的轨迹预测。

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and
restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into
multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in

their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal
Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that
successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study

Motivation: 解决无人机视角下小型多目标（如鸟类）跟踪的三大挑战：目标特征稀缺、相机与目标动态复杂、频繁遮挡和身份模糊。

Method: 采用跟踪-检测范式，提出SliceTrain检测增强框架和基于OC-SORT的独立外观跟踪器，结合运动方向维护和自适应相似度度量。

Result: 在SMOT4SB测试集上达到SO-HOTA分数55.205，表现最优。

Conclusion: 验证了框架在复杂SMOT问题中的有效性和先进性，代码开源。

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于深度学习的模型，利用出生24小时内的胸片预测极低出生体重婴儿的中重度支气管肺发育不良（BPD）结局，AUROC达0.78。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是一种慢性肺病，预防措施可能带来严重风险，因此早期预测至关重要。常规胸片可作为非侵入性预测工具。

Method: 使用163名极低出生体重婴儿的胸片数据，微调ResNet-50模型，采用渐进层冻结和CutMix增强技术。

Result: 模型AUROC为0.78，显著优于ImageNet初始化（p=0.031），且优于常规IRDS评分。

Conclusion: 领域特定预训练结合渐进冻结和线性探测，可实现高效BPD预测，适合临床推广。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

Conclusion: Med-OoD有效解决医学图像分割中的误分类问题，提出全新学习范式，重新定义OoD数据的作用。

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

Conclusion: DLC为扩散模型提供高效条件表示，支持高质量生成和组合性，扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",

Motivation: Vision Transformer 的高计算成本限制了其实际应用，现有方法在修剪令牌时忽略了令牌交互，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出 Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion (BSPF-ViT)，联合优化 Q/K 令牌修剪，并通过相似性融合保留关键信息。

Result: 在 ImageNet 分类任务中，BSPF-ViT 在 DeiT-T 和 DeiT-S 上分别提升 1.3% 和 2.0% 的准确率，同时减少 50% 的计算开销。

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT 在保持高准确率的同时显著降低了计算成本，适用于各种 Vision Transformer 模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

Conclusion: AutoVDC有潜力大幅改善自动驾驶大规模生产数据集的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双边网格和MLP的BPAM框架，用于图像增强，解决了现有方法在非线性映射和局部变化处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双边网格方法仅限于线性变换，而传统MLP方法难以处理局部变化，因此需要一种能结合两者优势的解决方案。

Method: 通过生成包含MLP参数的双边网格，每个像素动态获取独特的变换参数，并采用网格分解策略和多通道引导图优化参数生成。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，BPAM在性能上优于现有方法，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: BPAM框架成功结合了双边网格的空间建模能力和MLP的非线性映射能力，为图像增强提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

### [60] [QuRe: Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling in Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12416)
*Jaehyun Kwak,Ramahdani Muhammad Izaaz Inhar,Se-Young Yun,Sung-Ju Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为QuRe的方法，通过硬负采样减少假阴性，提升组合图像检索（CIR）的准确性和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法仅关注目标图像检索，忽视其他图像的相关性，导致假阴性问题，影响用户满意度。

Method: 提出QuRe方法，通过优化奖励模型目标和硬负采样策略，减少假阴性。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到最优性能，并在HP-FashionIQ数据集上最符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: QuRe有效解决了CIR中的假阴性问题，提升了检索质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-GS是一种自监督框架，用于从单一日志中高质量渲染驾驶场景，无需昂贵的手动标注，通过动态高斯和双向时间可见性掩模实现场景分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高质量方法依赖昂贵的手动标注，而自监督方法无法准确捕捉动态对象运动或正确分解场景，导致渲染伪影。

Method: AD-GS结合局部感知的B样条曲线和全局感知的三角函数，动态建模对象；使用伪2D分割自动分解场景，并通过可见性推理和物理刚性正则化增强鲁棒性。

Result: AD-GS在无标注方法中显著优于现有技术，并与依赖标注的方法竞争。

Conclusion: AD-GS提供了一种高效且高质量的自监督动态场景渲染解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for
self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly
manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to
capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为启发式或表达能力有限，需要一种更灵活且稳定的方法来建模人体姿态的先验分布。

Method: 利用RealNVP学习6D旋转格式的姿态密度，通过反转Gram-Schmidt过程实现稳定学习，并保持与旋转框架的兼容性。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估验证了方法的有效性，并通过消融实验分析了其影响。

Conclusion: 为人体运动捕捉和重建中的姿态先验提供了概率基础。

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior
over human body poses using normalizing flows. Unlike heuristic or
low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible
density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the
challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily
reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via
ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for
integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需预训练的高性能细粒度图像识别（FGIR）框架TGDA，通过数据增强和知识蒸馏实现，显著提升了低分辨率和高分辨率输入的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FGIR方法依赖预训练模型，限制了在资源受限环境中的适应性和任务特定架构的开发。

Method: 引入TGDA框架，结合数据感知增强和弱监督（通过细粒度感知教师模型的知识蒸馏），设计了任务特定架构（如LRNets和ViTFS）。

Result: 在多个FGIR基准测试中，TGDA框架性能优于或匹配现有预训练方法，尤其在低分辨率设置下，LRNets提升精度23%，参数和计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: TGDA展示了作为预训练替代方案的潜力，为高效细粒度视觉系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种双集成框架，结合预训练的深度学习模型和超参数优化的机器学习模型，以提高脑肿瘤MRI诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI诊断脑肿瘤时，人为因素可能导致误诊，因此需要更精确的自动化方法。

Method: 采用预训练的深度卷积神经网络和视觉变换网络提取特征，并结合超参数优化的机器学习分类器进行双集成。

Result: 实验表明，特征融合和分类器融合显著提升了分类性能，超参数优化进一步增强了效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在脑肿瘤分类中优于现有技术，并通过消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

Result: RadGazeIntent在预测放射科医生关注的发现时优于基线方法，适用于三种意图标记数据集。

Conclusion: RadGazeIntent成功建模了放射科医生的意图驱动行为，为医学图像分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

TL;DR: RODS是一种基于优化的扩散采样方法，通过几何线索检测和纠正高风险采样步骤，减少幻觉现象，提高采样保真度和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型的采样过程容易因分数近似不准确而产生幻觉，需要一种无需重新训练且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 通过优化视角重新解释扩散采样，利用损失景观的几何线索检测和纠正高风险步骤，实现更平滑的采样轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集上，RODS能检测70%以上的幻觉样本并纠正25%以上，同时避免引入新伪影。

Conclusion: RODS显著提升了扩散模型的采样质量，是一种高效且无需额外训练的改进方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用人脸质量相关属性，且缺乏有效的训练策略，限制了检测性能。

Method: 扩展了VQA数据集为DD-VQA+，引入Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA策略、多粒度提示学习和伪造感知训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本伪造判断和分析方面优于现有方法，准确率更高。

Conclusion: MGFFD-VLM框架显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: 生成式模型在医学图像短语定位中更具优势，为临床应用提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: 研究为健身领域的自动化工具开发提供了初步探索。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但也存在隐私泄露和偏见传播的风险，因此需要一种有效的方法来移除敏感或有害概念。

Method: FADE结合了轨迹感知的微调策略和对抗性目标，确保概念被可靠移除的同时保持模型整体性能。

Result: FADE在概念移除和图像质量上优于现有方法（如ESD、UCE等），并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: FADE为安全公平的生成建模设定了新标准，无需从头训练即可移除指定概念。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源有限平台上部署高精度杂草检测模型的挑战，特别是在区分视觉相似的杂草种类时。

Method: 使用YOLO11x作为教师模型，YOLO11n作为学生模型，应用CWD和MGD进行知识蒸馏。

Result: CWD和MGD分别提升了2.5%和1.9%的mAP50，且未增加模型复杂度。

Conclusion: CWD和MGD是提升深度学习杂草检测精度的有效方法，适用于精准农业和植物表型分析。

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本驱动的半监督医学图像分割框架Text-SemiSeg，通过文本增强视觉特征，提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像标注成本高的问题，利用文本信息增强视觉语义理解。

Method: 包括文本增强多平面表示（TMR）、类别感知语义对齐（CSA）和动态认知增强（DCA）三个模块。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上验证了模型的有效性，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg通过文本与视觉特征的交互，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Motivation: 开发可靠的监控系统需要多样化和具有挑战性的数据集，以全面评估模型性能并推动公共安全领域的发展。

Method: 提出了两个包含丰富标注的监控数据集，并在这些数据集上测试了多种先进目标检测架构（如RETMDET、YOLOX等）。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更高效和鲁棒的目标检测架构奠定了基础，并提供了对现有模型性能的深入分析。

Abstract: Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the
development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object
detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and
challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and
the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数InterpIoU，通过插值框解决现有IoU损失函数在非重叠情况下的问题，并引入动态调整的Dynamic InterpIoU，显著提升了小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoU损失函数在非重叠情况下不可微，且手工设计的几何惩罚项对框的形状、大小和分布敏感，导致小目标检测效果不佳和框扩大问题。

Method: 提出InterpIoU，用插值框与目标框的IoU替代手工惩罚项；进一步引入Dynamic InterpIoU，动态调整插值系数。

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC数据集上，新方法优于现有IoU损失函数，尤其在小目标检测中表现突出。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了现有损失函数的局限性，提升了目标检测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在视频识别中虽表现优异，但计算成本高昂，难以在设备端高效部署。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏和时空焦点调制技术，将大型预训练教师模型的知识迁移到紧凑的学生模型中。

Result: DVFL-Net在多个基准测试中表现出色，实现了性能与效率的平衡，内存和计算需求显著降低。

Conclusion: DVFL-Net是实时人类动作识别的实用解决方案，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

Motivation: 在文本密集的VQA任务中，细粒度文本信息提取至关重要，DAM的区域级描述能力为此提供了潜力。

Method: DAM-QA通过多区域视图聚合答案，优化文本相关证据的识别。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中，DAM-QA显著优于基线DAM，尤其在DocVQA上提升7+分，且参数更少。

Conclusion: DAM-QA展示了区域感知模型在文本密集VQA任务中的潜力，并缩小了与通用视觉语言模型的差距。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在跨模态理解中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，现有方法成本高或引入数据分布不匹配。

Method: 提出SENTINEL框架，通过迭代采样、验证对象存在性构建偏好数据，并采用上下文感知偏好损失（C-DPO）训练模型。

Result: 实验显示SENTINEL减少90%以上幻觉，在幻觉和通用能力基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SENTINEL通过早期干预和偏好学习有效解决幻觉问题，具有优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections
between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a

Conclusion: CytoSAE为医学影像提供了一种可解释的工具，能够识别疾病特异性概念，并在临床任务中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

Result: 发现评价一致性差异显著（α值1.00至0.35），识别出五种评价模式，且不同模型使用独特的评价词汇。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备类似人类批评家的个体化评价特征，而非中立基准工具。

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

*Varun Srivastava,Fan Lei,Srija Mukhopadhyay,Vivek Gupta,Ross Maciejewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MapIQ基准数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在地图视觉问答（Map-VQA）中的表现，填补了现有研究仅关注等值区域图的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Map-VQA研究主要集中于等值区域图，限制了研究的广度和深度。

Method: 构建包含14,706个问答对的MapIQ数据集，涵盖三种地图类型和六种主题，评估MLLMs在六种视觉分析任务中的表现，并与人类基准对比。

Result: 实验揭示了MLLMs的鲁棒性、敏感性及其对内部地理知识的依赖，为提升Map-VQA性能提供了方向。

Conclusion: MapIQ为Map-VQA研究提供了更全面的基准，揭示了MLLMs的局限性及改进空间。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语作为低资源语言，情感分析数据有限，研究旨在通过高资源语言的知识提升模型性能。

Method: 采用XLM-RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和DistilBERT三种预训练多语言模型，通过少样本和增量学习在波斯语数据上微调。

Result: mDeBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa表现最佳，准确率达96%。

Conclusion: 结合少样本学习、增量学习和多语言预训练模型在低资源语言情感分析中效果显著。

Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot
learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to
develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

TL;DR: PgM是一种多模态学习框架，通过分割模态特征为单模态和配对模态，分别学习并调整其分布，适用于多种下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习需要充分利用单模态和配对模态特征，但现有方法未能明确区分和优化这两类特征。

Method: PgM框架包含模态分割器、单模态学习器、配对模态学习器和单-配对模态解码器，分别处理特征分割、学习和重构。

Result: 实验证明PgM在四种多模态任务中有效，并展示了特征的分布和贡献。

Conclusion: PgM通过明确区分和优化单模态与配对模态特征，提升了多模态学习的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据科学和机器学习笔记本的依赖关系复杂，直接重新执行笔记本不切实际，而现有LLM在处理长上下文和避免幻觉方面存在不足，因此需要一种更可靠的方法来理解笔记本。

Method: 提出CRABS策略，结合浅层语法分析（AST）和LLM的零样本学习，通过上下界估计和歧义消除，生成信息流图和执行依赖图。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本的评估中，LLM成功解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和依赖关系识别上的F1分数分别达到98%和99%。

Conclusion: CRABS方法通过结合语法分析和LLM，显著提高了笔记本理解的准确性，为笔记本的评估和重用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Motivation: 研究旨在改进新闻文章中句子主观性检测的性能，尤其是在多语言和零样本设置下。

Method: 通过集成情感分数（来自辅助模型）与句子表示，增强Transformer分类器，并采用决策阈值校准处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 情感特征集成显著提升了性能，特别是在主观F1分数上，团队在希腊语任务中排名第一（Macro F1 = 0.51）。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言和零样本设置下表现优异，验证了情感特征对主观性检测的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过可重复性研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何处理相互矛盾的事实与反事实信息，重点关注注意力头的作用。研究发现，注意力头通过通用的复制抑制机制而非选择性反事实抑制来促进事实输出，且其行为具有领域依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于验证和调和近期三项关于LLMs中事实与反事实信息竞争的研究结果，进一步揭示注意力头的作用机制。

Method: 采用机械可解释性工具，分析注意力头强度与事实输出比例的关系，评估其抑制机制的竞争假设，并研究注意力模式的领域特异性。

Result: 研究发现，注意力头通过通用复制抑制机制促进事实输出，而非选择性反事实抑制；其行为具有领域依赖性，且更大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 结论表明，注意力头的作用机制是通用的，而非针对反事实的选择性抑制，且其行为受领域和模型规模影响。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

Result: 基线模型在语言识别任务中表现与当前最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: 该研究为印度语言的语言识别提供了新的数据集和模型，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了生成效率，同时保持了生成质量，为自回归模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

Result: 在CLOTH-F和MCQ数据集上表现优于基线，尤其在多样化数据上提升显著（P@1提升3.48-3.86%）。

Conclusion: DualReward能有效平衡从可靠人工示例中学习与探索高质量干扰项，适用于自动化测试生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs内部将“有害性”和“拒绝”编码为两个独立的概念，并提出了“有害性方向”作为新的安全机制分析维度。通过操纵这些方向，可以揭示模型的内部判断，并开发出更鲁棒的安全防护工具（Latent Guard）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正理解“有害性”而不仅仅是机械地拒绝指令，以及如何利用其内部表示提升AI安全性。

Method: 识别并分析LLMs内部的“有害性方向”和“拒绝方向”，通过操纵这些方向验证模型的内部判断，并开发Latent Guard作为安全应用。

Result: 发现“有害性”和“拒绝”是两个独立的概念，某些越狱方法仅降低拒绝信号而不改变模型对有害性的判断。Latent Guard在检测不安全输入方面表现优异。

Conclusion: LLMs对有害性的内部理解比拒绝决策更鲁棒，为AI安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

Motivation: 现有指令跟随数据集多为英语或机器翻译，限制了在多语言环境中的应用，因此需要更本地化的多语言基准。

Method: 通过结合翻译与验证的混合流程，创建了Marco-Bench-MIF，涵盖30种语言，并调整了语言和文化约束。

Result: 评估20+ LLMs发现：(1)高低资源语言间存在25-35%准确率差距；(2)模型规模影响性能45-60%，但仍存在脚本特定挑战；(3)机器翻译数据低估准确率7-22%。

Conclusion: Marco-Bench-MIF揭示了多语言指令跟随的挑战，如关键词一致性和跨语言约束遵循，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

### [103] [POLYCHARTQA: Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models with Multilingual Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11939)
*Yichen Xu,Liangyu Chen,Liang Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyChartQA是一个多语言图表问答基准，覆盖10种语言，旨在解决现有图表理解基准的英语中心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准主要针对英语，限制了其全球适用性，因此需要开发多语言基准。

Method: 采用解耦管道，分离图表数据和渲染代码，利用LLM翻译并严格质量控制生成多语言图表。

Result: 实验显示，英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为推进全球包容性视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

*Amos You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BlockBPE是一种并行GPU实现的字节对编码（BPE），优化了高吞吐量的批量推理，相比现有方法提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPU绑定的BPE实现在大规模推理任务中效率低下，无法充分利用GPU并行能力。

Method: BlockBPE通过消除Regex预分词步骤，实现高度并行化的线程块内合并，降低复杂度至O(nd)。

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE为GPU优化的BPE实现提供了高效解决方案，适用于大规模推理任务。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力感知的任务无关提示压缩方法（DAC），通过结合熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化，实现细粒度压缩。实验表明DAC在多领域任务和LLMs中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵压缩词汇单元，忽略了算法层面的关键注意力令牌和压缩过程中的熵变化。

Method: 提出动态注意力感知方法（DAC），结合熵和注意力信息，动态感知熵变化。

Result: 在LongBench、GSM8K和BBH等多个领域的实验中，DAC表现稳健且显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAC通过动态整合熵和注意力信息，实现了高效的提示压缩，适用于多种任务和LLMs。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

### [106] [IAM: Efficient Inference through Attention Mapping between Different-scale LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11953)
*Yi Zhao,Zuchao Li,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IAM框架通过利用不同规模LLMs间注意力矩阵的高相似性，优化注意力计算和KV缓存使用，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在长上下文场景下资源消耗大，现有方法仅利用模型内部稀疏性，未充分利用外部信息。

Method: 提出IAM框架，通过分析注意力矩阵相似性、选择映射层并验证一致性，实现小规模与大规模LLMs间的注意力映射。

Result: IAM加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，且性能损失微小，适用于多种模型系列。

Conclusion: IAM与现有KV缓存优化方法正交，是提升LLM效率的多功能工具。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在问答任务中表现优异，但在多跳推理和时间问题上仍有不足。基于查询的知识图谱问答（KGQA）提供了一种模块化替代方案。

Method: 采用多阶段查询框架，结合新的实体链接和谓词匹配方法，使用CoT推理。

Result: 在多跳和时间问答数据集上表现出色，证明了小语言模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 基于查询的多阶段KGQA框架能有效提升多跳和时间问答的性能。

Abstract: Large language models excel in question-answering (QA) yet still struggle
with multi-hop reasoning and temporal questions. Query-based knowledge graph QA
(KGQA) offers a modular alternative by generating executable queries instead of
direct answers. We explore multi-stage query-based framework for WikiData QA,
proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging
multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection
studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a novel entity linking and predicate matching method

*Xinyu Wang,Vahid Partovi Nia,Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的Power-of-two (PoT)量化框架，用于大型语言模型(LLM)的权重，旨在解决GPU上低精度量化效率低的问题，并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PoT量化在CPU上表现良好，但在GPU上效率较低，主要由于符号位纠缠和顺序位操作问题。论文旨在优化这一过程。

Method: 采用两步后训练算法：(i) 初始化量化尺度，(ii) 使用最小校准集优化尺度。

Result: 在极低精度（如2-和3-bit）下，该方法优于现有整数量化技术，并在NVIDIA V100和RTX 4090上分别实现了3.67倍和1.63倍的加速。

Conclusion: 提出的PoT量化框架在低精度下更高效，显著提升了LLM的推理速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

### [109] [Toxicity-Aware Few-Shot Prompting for Low-Resource Singlish Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11966)
*Ziyu Ge,Gabriel Chua,Leanne Tan,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，用于在低资源语言对中保留毒性的翻译，以新加坡英语（Singlish）为例，通过人工验证的少样本提示工程和模型优化，提升了翻译质量和文化敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，标准翻译系统难以处理低资源语言和方言中的俚语、混合编码及有害言论的文化标记，尤其是在毒性内容翻译时面临数据稀缺和安全过滤的挑战。

Method: 1. 人工验证的少样本提示工程：迭代筛选和排序标注者选定的Singlish目标示例，捕捉俚语、语气和毒性。2. 通过直接和回译的语义相似性基准测试，优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估证实了该框架的有效性和效率，不仅提升了翻译质量，还支持了低资源环境下的文化敏感内容审核和基准测试。

Conclusion: 该框架强调了在内容审核和区域平台治理等实际应用中保留社会语言细微差别的重要性，并将Singlish作为包容性NLP的测试平台。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

TL;DR: 研究比较人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）在阅读理解中的表现，通过图结构分析发现LLMs在语言理解上具有高度一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与LLMs在语言理解上的差异，以促进人机协同学习。

Method: 使用LLM将文本转化为图结构（节点和边），并通过眼动数据验证重要节点和边的注视分布。

Result: LLMs在图拓扑结构层面表现出高度一致的语言理解能力。

Conclusion: 研究为人类与AI的协同学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了价值相似性对LLM代理关系建立的影响，发现价值相似性高的代理间信任和亲密感更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索价值相似性在人工社会中是否像人类社会中一样影响关系建立。

Method: 通过两个实验：初步实验评估LLM中价值观的可控性；主实验生成具有特定价值观的代理对并分析其对话后的信任和亲密感。

Result: 价值相似性高的代理对表现出更强的信任和亲密感。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，并有助于理解价值观对关系建立的影响机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

### [112] [Simplifications are Absolutists: How Simplified Language Reduces Word Sense Awareness in LLM-Generated Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11981)
*Lukas Ellinger,Miriam Anschütz,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，简化定义会降低多义词的完整性，增加误解风险；通过微调模型可显著提升定义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨简化定义对不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）的影响，尤其是在多义词定义中可能导致的误导。

Method: 使用LLM-as-Judge和人工标注，评估多个模型在不同简化级别（Normal、Simple、ELI5）下的表现，并通过微调优化模型。

Result: 简化定义显著降低了多义词的完整性，而微调模型（如Llama 3.1 8B）能显著提升定义质量。

Conclusion: 教育类NLP需平衡简洁性与完整性，以确保为不同学习者提供可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效提升了神经语言模型的数据和参数效率，增强了模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Method: 测试包括多种任务，评估了基于派生、复合和隐喻的语言创造力，并使用OCSAI工具自动评估答案的原创性、精细度和灵活性。

Result: LLMs在所有评估标准上优于人类，并在八项任务中的六项中表现更好。人类更倾向于扩展性创造力，而LLMs偏向固定创造力。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言创造力测试中表现优于人类，但两者在创造力类型上存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF填补了长文本共指评估的空白，并揭示了当前模型在书籍规模下的挑战。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale
Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

Result: 学生在两个数据集中均认为MEGA方法更有利于学习，尤其在难度较高的MATH数据集中表现更优（47.5% vs 26.67%）。

Conclusion: MEGA方法在解释复杂数学问题时效果更好，可能成为改进数学教学的有效工具。

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

*Payal Bhattad,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao,Anju Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）文本增强的框架，包括可扩展性分析和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR），验证了其在提升语义保真度和多样性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保留方面的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成时导致的冗余和不稳定性。

Method: 提出两个评估组件：可扩展性分析（衡量语义一致性）和IASR（评估递归释义中的语义漂移）。

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真度、多样性和生成效率上表现最佳；在BERTopic任务中，主题粒度提升400%且完全消除主题重叠。

Conclusion: 验证了所提框架在实际NLP任务中对LLM增强的结构化评估的实用性。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

*Pavel Šindelář,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELOQUENT的Sensemaking任务通过三步评估生成模型的理解能力，发现现有方法在问题生成、回答限制和答案评估方面存在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为生成语言模型提供可测试的高层次评估标准。

Method: 采用三步评估流程（问题生成、问题回答、答案评分），结合自动与人工评估。

Result: 发现模型在问题生成质量评估、回答限制和答案评分准确性方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 需改进评估策略以提升模型在Sensemaking任务中的表现。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种行为翻译风格空间（BTSS），用于描述可能的翻译行为模式，并通过分析击键和注视数据揭示隐藏的认知过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过观察翻译行为（如眼动和手指运动）来理解翻译过程中的高阶认知和情感状态。

Method: 通过分析击键和注视数据，构建多层嵌套的BTSS，作为计算翻译代理的基础。

Result: BTSS能够模拟翻译过程中情感、自动化行为和认知的时间动态。

Conclusion: BTSS为研究翻译行为提供了新视角，并为计算翻译代理的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

*Reuben Smit,Retief Louw,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需自动语音识别（ASR）的方法，用于低资源环境下孤立单词阅读评估，通过对比儿童语音与少量成人参考模板，利用自监督学习（SSL）模型进行编码。实验表明，该方法在成人数据上表现良好，但在儿童数据上效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境下，传统的自动语音识别（ASR）方法难以适用，因此探索一种无需ASR的评估方法，尤其针对儿童语音数据。

Method: 采用少量样本学习方法，将儿童语音与成人参考模板进行比较，利用SSL模型的中间层进行编码，并研究离散化SSL特征和模板的质心平均等设计选项。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在成人数据上表现合理，但在儿童语音输入上效果显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL表示在低资源语音任务中表现良好，但本文揭示了其在少量样本分类系统中处理儿童数据的局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动语音识别（ASR）模型在通用语音转录中表现优异，但在识别上下文相关的关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，并采用后融合策略将ASR的声学信息与LLM的上下文知识结合。

Result: 在中英文数据集上的实验表明，该方法在关键词相关指标上达到最优性能，同时保持了非关键词文本的高准确率。

Conclusion: 多粒度融合框架中的词级和短语级组件相互补充，共同提升了性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为T-index的定量测量方法，用于评估翻译文本中的翻译腔（translationese），并通过对比微调的语言模型计算。实验表明T-index在跨领域和人工评估中表现稳健且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对翻译腔的定量测量，T-index旨在填补这一空白，提供一种通用且可扩展的评估工具。

Method: 使用合成数据集和真实翻译数据集，通过对比微调的语言模型计算T-index，并验证其在跨领域和人工评估中的表现。

Result: T-index能够有效捕捉翻译腔，其相对差异与人工标注一致，绝对值与人工评分相关性较高（Pearson's r = 0.568），且与现有MT质量评估指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index是一种稳健且高效的翻译腔测量方法，可作为现有MT质量评估指标的补充。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

TL;DR: Infherno是一个基于LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具的端到端框架，用于将自由形式的临床笔记转换为结构化FHIR资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在泛化性和结构一致性方面的不足。

Method: 结合LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具，设计端到端框架Infherno。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源方面表现优异，接近人类基准。

Conclusion: Infherno支持临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性，具有实用价值。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中广泛应用，但在硬件描述语言（如VHDL）中的研究和优化仍不足，因此需要评估和改进LLMs在该领域的适用性。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤（基于问题陈述或VHDL代码）并结合原始输入提示，以提升LLMs在VHDL代码生成和摘要中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在多个指标上显著优于标准提示策略，提高了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅改进了VHDL任务的性能，还为未来优化代码LLMs在VHDL领域的研究提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

Motivation: 探讨性别偏见在AD语音感知中的影响，为开发更公平的AD检测模型提供依据。

Method: 通过16名中文听众对中希语音的感知实验，结合声学分析（如shimmer值和语音部分）。

Result: 男性语音更易被识别为AD，shimmer值与AD感知显著相关，语言对AD感知无显著影响。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在模型开发中解决，并进一步验证跨语言性能。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在处理用户请求时的模糊性问题，提升其交互能力。

Method: 采用三种LLM架构（Llama3-8B、Gemma2-9B和Mistral-7B）和多样化模糊性数据集，设计多智能体辩论框架。

Result: 辩论框架显著提升了Llama3-8B和Mistral-7B的性能，Mistral-7B主导的辩论成功率达76.7%。

Conclusion: 辩论框架是一种有效提升LLM能力的方法，为开发更鲁棒和自适应的语言理解系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖静态数据，而具备网页浏览能力的LLMs可以实时获取信息，但其在社交媒体数据上的能力尚未被研究。

Method: 使用合成数据集（48个X/Twitter账户）和调查数据集（1,384名国际参与者），评估LLMs是否能通过用户名预测用户 demographics。

Result: LLMs能够访问社交媒体内容并预测用户 demographics，但可能引入性别和政治偏见。

Conclusion: 该能力对计算社会科学有益，但也存在滥用风险，建议限制公开应用，保留研究用途的受控访问。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否能够检测算术错误，以实现模型的自我纠正。

Method: 从3位数加法开始，训练探针解码隐藏状态，构建错误检测器，并扩展到结构化思维链任务。

Result: 探针能准确解码模型输出和正确答案，错误检测器准确率超90%，且能提升任务准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，轻量级探针为模型自我纠正提供可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的RAG框架，结合混合检索策略和元数据感知过滤，显著提升了企业数据处理的准确性和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业依赖专有数据决策，但现有LLMs和RAG框架在处理异构数据时存在局限性。

Method: 结合密集嵌入和BM25检索，使用SpaCy NER和交叉编码器重排序，保留表格结构并优化检索效率。

Result: 实验显示Precision@5提升15%，Recall@5提升13%，定性评估中Faithfulness、Completeness和Relevance得分显著提高。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升了企业任务的响应质量，未来将扩展至多模态数据和基于代理的检索。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),

### [133] [Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12428)
*Yik Siu Chan,Zheng-Xin Yong,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过线性探针分析思维链（CoT）的激活信号，能更准确地预测最终回答的安全性，优于基于文本的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨思维链（CoT）是否可用于预测最终回答的对齐风险，以减少有害内容的生成。

Method: 评估多种监测方法（人类、大语言模型、文本分类器），比较基于CoT文本和激活信号的预测效果。

Result: 线性探针在CoT激活信号上的表现优于文本方法，且能在推理未完成时提前预测安全性。

Conclusion: 轻量级探针可实现实时安全监控，适用于不同模型和任务。

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

*Suman Adhya,Debarshi Kumar Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S2WTM提出了一种新的主题建模方法，通过利用球形切片Wasserstein距离解决VAE-NTMs中的后验崩溃问题，生成更一致和多样化的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE-NTMs在建模高维文本数据的超球面潜在表示时容易发生后验崩溃，导致潜在表示无效。

Method: S2WTM采用单位超球面上的先验分布，并利用球形切片Wasserstein距离对齐后验分布与先验。

Result: 实验表明S2WTM优于现有主题模型，生成的主题更一致和多样化，且在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: S2WTM通过改进潜在空间建模，有效解决了后验崩溃问题，提升了主题建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BETR的显式优化数据选择方法，通过将预训练数据与评估基准对齐，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索显式优化数据选择方法的效果，而非传统的隐式迭代优化。

Method: 提出BETR方法，通过嵌入基准示例和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分选择数据，并训练轻量级分类器预测全库分数。

Result: 实验表明，BETR在10项任务中有9项表现优于基线，计算效率提升2.1倍。同时，BETR在多样化基准上也能匹配或超越基线。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能精确塑造模型能力，且数据选择策略需根据模型规模调整。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Conclusion: AI为可持续技术生态系统提供了未来研究方向，结合科学、艺术和环保实践。

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human
dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI)
can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI
interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists
and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological
restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue
that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings
highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and
environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of
perception, memory, and reasoning components, enabling a single LLM or VLM
backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human
experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为验证器在复杂任务中表现出‘同意偏见’，即倾向于支持上下文中的信息。提出的自我基础验证（SGV）方法显著提升了验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用）中，如何利用MLLMs作为验证器以扩展AI进展是一个挑战。

Method: 提出自我基础验证（SGV），通过无条件生成和条件生成两步利用MLLMs的知识和推理能力。

Result: SGV使MLLM验证器在准确性和故障检测率上提升高达20点，并在多个任务中实现实时监督，性能提升48%。

Conclusion: SGV有效解决了MLLMs的同意偏见问题，显著提升了其在复杂任务中的验证能力。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

TL;DR: 论文提出DP-Bench基准和DPLM模型，通过DualReflect数据生成方法解决动态规划（DP）问题中LLM应用的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态规划（DP）建模通常依赖专家知识，而现有LLM方法难以直接应用于DP问题。

Method: 提出DPLM模型和DualReflect数据生成方法，结合前向和后向生成策略。

Result: DPLM在DP-Bench上表现优于现有LLM，尤其在复杂问题上。

Conclusion: 前向和后向生成方法的结合是解决DP问题的关键。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

Conclusion: 通过结合GPU和CPU的并行能力，论文提出的方法显著提升了DFS的效率，为搜索算法的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

Result: 在多个基准测试（GAIA、SWE-bench Verified、WebVoyager）中，Aime表现优于现有最先进的专用智能体。

Conclusion: Aime为多智能体协作提供了更具适应性和高效性的基础框架。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Result: 智能体主要关注光流不连续区域和大光流区域，行为类似昆虫，且在不同训练中表现一致。

Conclusion: 该策略可能适用于开发简单明确的无人机控制法则。

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习（MARL）中因联合状态-动作空间指数增长而加剧的探索-利用权衡问题，特别是在混合交通场景中。

Result: 在不同交通密度和CAV渗透率下，TPE-MARL在交通效率、安全性、决策平滑性和任务完成度上表现优异，且决策合理性接近或超过人类驾驶员。

Conclusion: TPE-MARL通过拓扑张量和探索-利用平衡，显著提升了MARL在混合交通中的性能，为CAV协同决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future
histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an
18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results
point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in
spatially complex areas.

TL;DR: 提出CompressedVQA-HDR框架，用于评估HDR视频压缩质量，结合Swin Transformer和SigLip 2网络，在FR和NR模型中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法对HDR内容泛化能力不足，需开发更通用的VQA框架。

Method: FR模型使用Swin Transformer提取结构和纹理相似性；NR模型利用SigLip 2提取全局特征。通过预训练和微调解决数据不足问题。

Result: 模型在HDR视频质量评估中表现最优，FR模型在IEEE ICME 2025挑战赛中夺冠。

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR框架有效解决了HDR视频质量评估的挑战，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and
models will be publicly accessible and ready to use at
https://github.com/Medical-Image-Analysis-Laboratory/ and
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15911797.
