*Andreas Alpers,Orkun Furat,Christian Jung,Matthias Neumann,Claudia Redenbach,Aigerim Saken,Volker Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比分析了多种算法策略，用于将镶嵌模型拟合到3D图像数据中，评估了不同优化方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在材料科学中，准确拟合3D图像数据（如多晶体和泡沫）的镶嵌模型是一个重要问题，需要高效的算法策略。

Method: 比较了线性/非线性规划、随机优化（交叉熵法）和梯度下降等方法，用于生成Voronoi、Laguerre和广义平衡功率图（GBPDs）。

Result: 通过实际数据集评估了拟合质量，发现模型复杂度、优化方法复杂度和近似质量之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据数据特征和应用需求选择合适方法提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of algorithmic strategies for
fitting tessellation models to 3D image data of materials such as polycrystals
and foams. In this steadily advancing field, we review and assess
optimization-based methods -- including linear and nonlinear programming,
stochastic optimization via the cross-entropy method, and gradient descent --
for generating Voronoi, Laguerre, and generalized balanced power diagrams
(GBPDs) that approximate voxelbased grain structures. The quality of fit is
evaluated on real-world datasets using discrepancy measures that quantify
differences in grain volume, surface area, and topology. Our results highlight
trade-offs between model complexity, the complexity of the optimization
routines involved, and the quality of approximation, providing guidance for
selecting appropriate methods based on data characteristics and application
needs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习在语义分割中的应用，提出多种高效模型，并验证了选择合适的骨干网络对性能的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能（尤其是深度学习）在复杂任务中表现出色，减少了人类专家的需求。本文旨在通过语义分割提升场景理解能力，特别是在自动驾驶领域。

Method: 使用BDD100k数据集，提出多种高效模型，并尝试不同骨干网络作为编码器。

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
prominent keyword because it is promising in solving complex tasks. The need
for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines
have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the
right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help
of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence
technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the
development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In
this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene
understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to
investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of
several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that
choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the
model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation
allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.
In the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,
mean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are
improved.

### [3] [CLIPTTA: Robust Contrastive Vision-Language Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14312)
*Marc Lafon,Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim,Clément Rambour,Christian Desrosier,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPTTA是一种基于梯度的测试时适应方法，针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）设计，通过软对比损失与CLIP的预训练目标对齐，解决了熵最小化目标的不匹配问题，并在开放集设置中进一步优化了OOD检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。现有的测试时适应（TTA）方法（如熵最小化）与VLMs的对比训练目标不匹配，导致性能受限和失败模式（如伪标签漂移和类别崩溃）。

Method: 提出CLIPTTA，一种基于梯度的TTA方法，采用软对比损失与CLIP的预训练目标对齐，并通过理论分析证明其批次感知设计可避免崩溃风险。扩展至开放集设置，使用Outlier Contrastive Exposure（OCE）损失改进OOD检测。

Result: 在75个数据集上的实验表明，CLIPTTA在分布偏移下表现稳定，优于基于熵的目标，并与最先进的TTA方法竞争，甚至在某些数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: CLIPTTA通过对齐预训练目标的软对比损失，显著提升了VLMs在测试时的适应能力，并在开放集设置中进一步优化了OOD检测，展现出强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities
but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation
(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically
via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned
with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation
performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class
collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for
vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with
CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's
gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.
We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier
Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75
datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms
entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA
methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more
stable performance across diverse shifts.

### [4] [A Hidden Stumbling Block in Generalized Category Discovery: Distracted Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14315)
*Qiyu Xu,Zhanxuan Hu,Yu Duan,Ercheng Pei,Yonghang Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为注意力聚焦（AF）的机制，通过修剪非信息性标记来解决广义类别发现（GCD）中的注意力分散问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法在处理未标记数据时容易受到背景区域的干扰，导致特征提取不理想。

Method: AF由两个组件组成：标记重要性度量（TIME）和多尺度标记自适应修剪（TAP），通过量化标记重要性并修剪非信息性标记来优化模型注意力。

Result: 将AF集成到SimGCD方法中，性能提升了15.4%，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: AF是一种轻量级、即插即用的模块，能有效提升GCD方法的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabeled data from
both known and unknown categories by leveraging knowledge from labeled known
categories. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often
overlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,
when processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in
the image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal
feature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention
Focusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by
pruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective
components: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning
(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple
scales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale
importance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module
that integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational
overhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves
up to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal
computational overhead. The implementation code is provided in
https://github.com/Afleve/AFGCD.

### [5] [Hallucination Score: Towards Mitigating Hallucinations in Generative Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14367)
*Weiming Ren,Raghav Goyal,Zhiming Hu,Tristan Ty Aumentado-Armstrong,Iqbal Mohomed,Alex Levinshtein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量和减少生成超分辨率（GSR）中幻觉问题的方法，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）生成“幻觉分数”（HS），并通过深度特征距离优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成超分辨率（GSR）在感知图像质量上表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，即生成细节与低分辨率图像或真实图像不匹配，影响实际应用。现有指标无法有效衡量这一问题。

Method: 利用MLLM构建提示，评估幻觉视觉元素并生成HS；发现深度特征距离与HS强相关，提出将其作为可微奖励函数优化GSR模型。

Result: HS与人类评估高度一致，并为超分辨率模型提供了补充性见解；深度特征距离与HS强相关。

Conclusion: 提出的HS和深度特征距离优化方法有效减少了GSR中的幻觉问题，提升了模型的实用性和图像质量。

Abstract: Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in
terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur
of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models
do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity.
Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to
perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI),
is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical
deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating
these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are
not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they
are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we
take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a
prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a
"Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human
evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics
used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep
feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to
align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions
to mitigate hallucinations.

### [6] [DUSTrack: Semi-automated point tracking in ultrasound videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14368)
*Praneeth Namburi,Roger Pallarès-López,Jessica Rosendorf,Duarte Folgado,Brian W. Anthony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUSTrack是一个结合深度学习和光流的半自动化工具包，用于B超视频中的点追踪，解决了噪声和运动模糊等问题，并在多种应用中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: B超图像中的组织运动追踪因噪声、低对比度和平面外运动而困难，需要一种通用且准确的方法来量化组织动态。

Method: 结合深度学习和光流技术，提供图形界面支持训练数据生成和模型迭代优化，并引入光流滤波减少噪声。

Result: DUSTrack在精度上优于零样本点追踪器，与专用方法相当，适用于心脏、肌肉等多种应用场景。

Conclusion: DUSTrack是一个开源、通用的工具，为临床和生物力学研究提供了强大的组织运动量化框架。

Abstract: Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is
available at https://github.com/praneethnamburi/DUSTrack.

### [7] [CRAFT: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Visual Functional Affordance Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14426)
*Zhou Chen,Joe Lin,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个神经符号框架，用于可解释的affordance grounding，结合了ConceptNet和语言模型的结构化常识先验与CLIP的视觉证据，通过基于能量的推理循环迭代优化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景理解中对象与动作关联的可解释性问题，提升稳健性和可信度。

Method: 整合ConceptNet和语言模型的结构化常识先验与CLIP的视觉证据，采用基于能量的推理循环迭代优化预测。

Result: 在无标签的多对象场景中，CRAFT提高了准确性并增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: CRAFT为稳健且可信的场景理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT, a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable affordance
grounding, which identifies the objects in a scene that enable a given action
(e.g., "cut"). CRAFT integrates structured commonsense priors from ConceptNet
and language models with visual evidence from CLIP, using an energy-based
reasoning loop to refine predictions iteratively. This process yields
transparent, goal-driven decisions to ground symbolic and perceptual
structures. Experiments in multi-object, label-free settings demonstrate that
CRAFT enhances accuracy while improving interpretability, providing a step
toward robust and trustworthy scene understanding.

### [8] [Adaptive 3D Gaussian Splatting Video Streaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14432)
*Han Gong,Qiyue Li,Zhi Liu,Hao Zhou,Peng Yuan Zhou,Zhu Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯变形场的3DGS视频流媒体框架，通过混合显著性分块和差异化质量建模，实现了高效压缩和带宽适应，实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）视频的数据量大且传输复杂，传统方法难以应对，因此需要一种新的流媒体框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了基于高斯变形场的3DGS视频构建方法，结合混合显著性分块和差异化质量建模，实现高效压缩和带宽适应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频质量、压缩效率和传输速率等方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了3DGS视频流媒体的挑战，为高质量传输提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has significantly enhanced the
quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to
conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for
streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened
complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues,
we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming.
Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian
deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated
quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and
adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality.
Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the
transmission performance. Through experimental evaluation, our method
demonstrated superiority over existing approaches in various aspects, including
video quality, compression effectiveness, and transmission rate.

### [9] [IRGPT: Understanding Real-world Infrared Image with Bi-cross-modal Curriculum on Large-scale Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14449)
*Zhe Cao,Jin Zhang,Ruiheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRGPT是首个针对真实红外图像的多模态大语言模型，基于26万对真实红外图像与文本的数据集（IR-TD），通过双跨模态课程迁移学习策略，在9项任务中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖合成红外图像、难以捕捉红外模态独特特性的问题。

Method: 构建大规模IR-TD数据集，结合LLM生成和规则标注的文本，提出双跨模态课程迁移学习策略。

Result: 在9项任务中实现最优性能，超越更大规模模型。

Conclusion: IRGPT通过真实数据和迁移学习策略，显著提升了红外图像的多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language
models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific
characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their
reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from
visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique
characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,
the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,
built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K
authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared
images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts
originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of
visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we
introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that
systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by
considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT
achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.

### [10] [GPI-Net: Gestalt-Guided Parallel Interaction Network via Orthogonal Geometric Consistency for Robust Point Cloud Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14452)
*Weikang Gu,Mingyue Han,Li Xue,Heng Dong,Changcai Yang,Riqing Chen,Lifang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Gestalt原则的并行交互网络（GPI-Net），用于点云配准中的高质量对应关系识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部和全局特征融合中的冗余和复杂空间关系问题。

Method: 利用Gestalt原则设计正交几何一致性策略，结合Gestalt特征注意力块（GFA）和双路径多粒度并行交互聚合块（DMG）。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPI-Net通过Gestalt原则优化特征融合，显著提升了点云配准的准确性。

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Result: 实验表明，所提方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文提出的解决方案有效解决了3DGS视频流媒体的关键挑战，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a
research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability
to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is
still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,
quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of
solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by
saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each
tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and
multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel
quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates
spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the
quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a
meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS
video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

*Chi Wan,Yixin Cui,Jiatong Du,Shuo Yang,Yulong Bai,Yanjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEMINUS是一个混合专家端到端自动驾驶框架，通过全局专家、场景自适应专家组和双感知路由器实现多样场景下的自适应和鲁棒性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模式规划方法难以处理多样化驾驶场景，需要一种能适应复杂交通环境的框架。

Method: 提出GEMINUS框架，包含全局专家、场景自适应专家组和双感知路由器，动态激活专家模块。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优异，驾驶分数和成功率均领先，单目视觉输入下仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: GEMINUS通过混合专家设计显著提升了自动驾驶的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of
complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode
planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire
diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework
featuring a Global Expert, a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, and equipped with a
Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall
dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained
on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware
Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty
to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the
Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router,
GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS
outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even
with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate
significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in
Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean. The
code will be available at https://github.com/newbrains1/GEMINUS.

*Huayuan Ye,Juntong Chen,Shenzhuo Zhang,Yipeng Zhang,Changbo Wang,Chenhui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisGuard是一个抗篡改的可视化图像数据检索框架，通过嵌入元数据链接解决现有方法易受图像裁剪和编辑影响的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可视化图像中嵌入元数据时易受篡改影响，导致信息丢失，VisGuard旨在解决这一问题。

Method: VisGuard采用重复数据平铺、可逆信息广播和基于锚点的裁剪定位技术，增强嵌入数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明VisGuard在数据检索准确性、嵌入容量和抗篡改安全性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VisGuard能有效保护和促进可视化传播与信息传递。

Abstract: The dissemination of visualizations is primarily in the form of raster
images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source
code, interactive features, and metadata. While previous methods have proposed
embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval
(VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to
common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing.
To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework
that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data
link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We
propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data
tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for
crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive
chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval
accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis,
demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding
visualization dissemination and information conveyance.

*Zhenyu Li,Tianyi Shang,Pengjie Xu,Ruirui Zhang,Fanchen Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OptiCorNet提出了一种新颖的序列建模框架，结合空间特征提取和时间差分，通过端到端训练提升动态环境中的视觉地点识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态和感知混淆环境中的视觉地点识别（VPR）是长期定位的核心挑战，现有方法多忽略时间连贯性。

Method: 采用轻量级1D卷积编码器和可学习差分时间算子（DSD），结合LSTM和四元组损失，直接学习序列级嵌入。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，OptiCorNet在季节和视角变化下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OptiCorNet通过端到端学习序列级嵌入，显著提升了动态环境中的地点识别效果。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in dynamic and perceptually aliased
environments remains a fundamental challenge for long-term localization.
Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame
embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This
paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies
spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,
end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D
convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,
termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term
spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models
directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing
kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,
yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance
shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a
quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative
divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal
aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings
directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint
variations.

### [15] [DFQ-ViT: Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers without Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14481)
*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Tian Zhang,Jianquan Liu,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFQ-ViT提出了一种无需数据的ViT量化方法，通过合成高质量样本和激活校正矩阵，显著提升了量化模型的性能，且无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFQ方法在合成样本时未能充分平衡全局和局部特征，且量化模型与全精度模型的中间层激活分布差异大，导致性能下降。

Method: 按难度递增顺序合成样本，并引入激活校正矩阵对齐量化模型与全精度模型的中间层激活。

Result: DFQ-ViT性能优于现有DFQ方法，接近真实数据量化模型，例如3位量化的DeiT-T性能提升4.29%。

Conclusion: DFQ-ViT无需微调，降低了计算开销和部署门槛，符合绿色学习原则，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers
(ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on
devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be
calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic
samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global
and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data
quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant
difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the
quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance
degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a
pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).
Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,
effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and
inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the
quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the
full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves
remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par
with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T
with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our
method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces
computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge
devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by
improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in
resource-constrained environments.

*Hongye Hou,Liu Zhan,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强的点云补全框架，通过跨模态检索学习结构先验信息，生成精细点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完整点云补全任务中缺乏典型结构特征的挑战，提升生成能力和泛化能力。

Method: 设计了结构共享特征编码器（SSFE）和渐进检索增强生成器（PRAG），通过双通道控制门和分层特征融合机制整合参考样本的先验信息。

Result: 在多个数据集和真实场景中验证了方法的有效性，能够生成精细点云并处理稀疏数据和未见类别。

Conclusion: 该方法在点云补全任务中表现出色，具有广泛的适用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Completing the whole 3D structure based on an incomplete point cloud is a
challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical
structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning
attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.
However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their
generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented
point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal
retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from
similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature
Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct
reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in
the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced
and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose
a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical
feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input
features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in
generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability
in handling sparse data and unseen categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCP-LLaVA是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过令牌压缩技术解决病理学全切片图像（WSI）的视觉问答（VQA）问题，显著降低计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学全切片图像（WSI）的高分辨率和长上下文长度对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）提出了挑战，现有方法在生成能力和资源消耗上存在不足。

Method: 提出TCP-LLaVA模型，通过可训练的压缩令牌聚合视觉和文本信息，仅将压缩后的令牌输入语言模型，减少计算成本。

Result: 在十种TCGA肿瘤亚型的实验中，TCP-LLaVA在VQA准确率上优于现有基线模型，并大幅降低训练资源消耗。

Conclusion: TCP-LLaVA为WSI的VQA任务提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000
pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model
(MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous
methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification
using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the
generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent
MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly
into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To
address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA
(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token
compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that
aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,
inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are
forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length
and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that
TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing
training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖光流或深度估计，而神经形态传感器的事件数据具有稀疏性和高时间分辨率，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 利用事件数据，结合几何约束，通过优化流程进行事件过分割、残差分析独立运动物体，并基于运动相似性和时间一致性进行层次聚类。

Result: 在EVIMO2v2数据集上验证了方法的准确性，尤其在物体边界表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时机器人和导航应用中具有显著优势与潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a robust framework for motion segmentation and
egomotion estimation using event-based normal flow, tailored specifically for
neuromorphic vision sensors. In contrast to traditional methods that rely
heavily on optical flow or explicit depth estimation, our approach exploits the
sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data and incorporates geometric
constraints between normal flow, scene structure, and inertial measurements.
The proposed optimization-based pipeline iteratively performs event
over-segmentation, isolates independently moving objects via residual analysis,
and refines segmentations using hierarchical clustering informed by motion
similarity and temporal consistency. Experimental results on the EVIMO2v2
dataset validate that our method achieves accurate segmentation and
translational motion estimation without requiring full optical flow
computation. This approach demonstrates significant advantages at object
boundaries and offers considerable potential for scalable, real-time robotic
and navigation applications.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and view synthesis are foundational problems in computer
vision, graphics, and immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR),
virtual reality (VR), and digital twins. Traditional methods rely on
computationally intensive iterative optimization in a complex chain, limiting
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in feed-forward

view synthesis, with a taxonomy according to the underlying representation
architectures including point cloud, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free
reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video
synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics,
and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed
statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We
conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for
future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance
the state of the art in 3D vision.

Motivation: 现有方法在多视角行人检测中引入噪声且精度低，依赖昂贵的3D标注且难以泛化。

Method: 采用超像素高斯溅射实现多视角深度一致性，生成精确点云用于行人定位。

Result: 显著减少噪声，优于现有方法，首次在挑战性场景中重建行人并实现多视角分割。

Conclusion: DCHM无需人工标注，在多场景中表现优异，为行人检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling
and pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space
by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection
accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low
precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D
annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To
eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we
propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for
consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.
Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting
achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded
scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.
Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise
during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.
Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians
and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting. Code is
available on the \href{https://jiahao-ma.github.io/DCHM/}{project page}.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of educational applications, artistic creation, and
AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical
requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly
demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and
professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA
methods demonstrate stronger perceptual and generalization capabilities
compared to traditional approaches, yet they suffer from modality bias
(score-only or text-only) and lack fine-grained attribute decomposition,
thereby failing to support further aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we
present:(1) ArtiMuse, an innovative MLLM-based IAA model with Joint Scoring and
Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first
expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main
categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with
8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score. Both the model and

Conclusion: 该浏览器扩展为听障人士提供了更自然的视频会议交流方式，提升了沟通效率。

Abstract: It has always been a rather tough task to communicate with someone possessing
a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a
communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many
people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign
language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the
communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can
properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole
world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have
become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent
studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign
over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser
extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for
everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more
than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will
be used.

Motivation: 解决情感认知科学中外部情感刺激与人类内部体验关系建模的挑战，特别是探索ANN在模拟个体感知差异方面的潜力。

Method: 引入一种新颖的感知边界采样方法生成ANN决策边界上的模糊面部表情刺激，构建varEmotion数据集，并通过大规模人类行为实验验证假设。

Conclusion: 研究建立了ANN决策边界与人类感知变异性之间的系统性联系，为个性化情感解释建模提供了新视角。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in affective cognitive science is to develop models
that accurately capture the relationship between external emotional stimuli and
human internal experiences. While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in
facial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual
differences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates
the phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit
significant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same
stimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we
hypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN
classifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.
To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling
method to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision
boundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,
constructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis
reveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual
uncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles
in emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using
behavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both
group-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns. Our findings
establish a systematic link between ANN decision boundaries and human
perceptual variability, offering new insights into personalized modeling of
emotional interpretation.

Result: 用户研究表明，系统能有效帮助用户快速识别杂乱并提升照片质量。

Conclusion: 系统提供了灵活的界面和精准的算法，显著改善了用户的摄影体验。

Abstract: Clutter in photos is a distraction preventing photographers from conveying
the intended emotions or stories to the audience. Photography amateurs
frequently include clutter in their photos due to unconscious negligence or the
lack of experience in creating a decluttered, aesthetically appealing scene for
shooting. We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that
provides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We
estimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics
and content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify
clutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes
cluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with
different kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical
novelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment
algorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image
inpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs
missing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies
demonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate
algorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher
quality images within less time.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 语言引导的关系表示能有效提升复杂室内场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires
reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D
scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,
particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles
and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and
powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects
using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D
embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that
captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These
relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level
integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for
unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and
question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional
supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,
Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms
strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided
relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.

Conclusion: LEAD通过紧密对齐优化目标和ODE的非线性建模能力，有效解决了预训练模型选择问题。

Abstract: The remarkable success of pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has led to a
proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge
presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable
pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge
lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the
underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning
dynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely
align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential
nonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a
finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD
proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution
toward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware
decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes
and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned
optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the
differential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively
bridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning
process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised
pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive
performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.

Motivation: 减少MRI扫描时间和成本，通过计算合成缺失的对比度图像。

Method: 使用GAN、扩散模型和流匹配技术进行T1w到T2w的2D MRI图像转换，并在三个公开数据集上评估。

Result: GAN-based Pix2Pix模型表现最佳，流匹配方法在小数据集上容易过拟合。

Conclusion: GAN更适合实际MRI工作流，未来研究可探索更多数据以提升流匹配性能。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image
contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering
distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities
increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods
for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize
missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time
while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides
a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All
frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three
publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms
diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,
and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these
results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small
datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN
performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I
translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising
directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis. Code and
models are publicly available at

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring.
Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell
morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep
learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high

The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also
classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal
variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as
image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy
for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction
applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing,
medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with
facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes
is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose
Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships
among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression
recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are
used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based
on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local
appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.
Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and
integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph
learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic
representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph
convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global
dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition
of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed
Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.
The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%,
respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong
generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and
real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for
practical facial expression recognition applications.

TL;DR: DD-SAM2是一个高效的自适应框架，通过Depthwise-Dilated Adapter增强SAM2的多尺度特征提取，适用于医学视频分割与跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法多为模态特定设计，适应性差，且SAM2及其变体在医学视频场景中需要大规模数据集重新训练，计算成本高。

Method: 提出DD-SAM2框架，结合Depthwise-Dilated Adapter，以最小参数量增强多尺度特征提取，实现有限数据下的高效微调。

Result: 在TrackRad2025和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上表现优异，Dice分数分别达到0.93和0.97。

Conclusion: DD-SAM2为医学视频分割与跟踪提供了一种高效的SAM2微调方法，代码与模型将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep
learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific
designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a
streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new
opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting
these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets
for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and
the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose
DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a
Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective
fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike
existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully
exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and
segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)
and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior
performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically
exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and
tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at

Motivation: 生成式AI的进步增加了虚假信息的风险，现有单模态检测方法无法应对多模态合成内容。

Method: 采用强化学习后训练策略（多阶段训练、思维奖励、混合推理）设计跨模态检测框架BusterX++。

Result: 实验证明BusterX++在性能上显著提升，并具有通用性。

Conclusion: BusterX++为跨模态合成媒体检测提供了有效解决方案，GenBuster++基准支持全面评估。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video
synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation
through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved
from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic
media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their
single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately,
making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media
formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel
framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of
synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning
(RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage
Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and
substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging
state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark
comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts
using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and
real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalizability of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型的多光谱特征融合框架MS2Fusion，通过双路径参数交互机制解决现有方法在局部互补特征偏好和计算复杂度上的问题，显著提升了多光谱目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多光谱特征融合方法过度关注局部互补特征而忽略跨模态共享语义，且难以平衡感受野大小与计算复杂度，限制了泛化性能和可扩展性。

Method: MS2Fusion采用状态空间模型（SSM），通过双路径参数交互机制：一条路径挖掘跨模态互补信息，另一路径探索跨模态对齐的共享语义特征。两条路径在SSM中联合优化。

Result: 在FLIR、M3FD和LLVIP等主流基准测试中，MS2Fusion显著优于其他多光谱目标检测方法，并在RGB-T语义分割和RGBT显著目标检测任务中表现出通用性。

Conclusion: MS2Fusion通过双路径交互机制实现了高效的多光谱特征融合，兼具功能互补性和共享语义空间，适用于多种多光谱感知任务。

Abstract: Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical
limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over
cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and
(2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity
present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these
issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed
MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving
efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction
mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch
inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information
with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter
branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain
cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing
in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing
multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy
both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive
experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our
MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object
detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general
and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even
without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T
semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its
generality. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/61s61min/MS2Fusion.git.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating
represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive
environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video
Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent
enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces
FST.ai, a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport
Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick
detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge
inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key
actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while
improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not
limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation,
motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of
sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team
sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance
tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging
scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability,
and sport-agnostic potential of FST.ai to transform officiating standards
across multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is
essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study
presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level
food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and
after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models
(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped
dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a
comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a
custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the
task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at
least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment
in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter
counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4
GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more
rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or
viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically
post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,
constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is
pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous
monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for
automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service
environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future
directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce
institutional food waste.

Result: 在公共空间转录组数据集上，Gene-DML实现了最先进的基因表达预测性能。

Conclusion: Gene-DML通过联合建模细粒度和结构级判别，提升了跨模态表征的鲁棒性和预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a
scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant
implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However,
existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment
between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple
representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To
address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent
space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence
between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale
instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology
representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene
expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional
relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination
pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)
instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening
the alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and
structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal
representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across
diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial
transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art
performance in gene expression prediction. The code and checkpoints will be
released soon.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains
inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets.
While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial
solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts,
multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this
work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to
support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes
diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real
question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the
dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately
handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments
demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and
efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting
a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel
tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through
natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models.
Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to
balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains
underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we
propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal
WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust
task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific
accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task
allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch
and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through
internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge
bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the
final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on
multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs
and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and
are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR
models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen
and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a
teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot
abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation
Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt
Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal
knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to
recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.
Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental
Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze
rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed
scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align
rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the
Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively
capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned
multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a
stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,
bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction
bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving
superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further
demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.

Abstract: Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural
practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration,
food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing
agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or
regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced
terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we
introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global
Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset
covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex
terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution
images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask
labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and
transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing
datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1)
terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple
domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks,
including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the
GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction
methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level
metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research,
providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis
and cross-scenario knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: MultiRetNet可降低医疗成本，提高早期检测率，减少医疗资源分配不均，促进医疗公平。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness,
affecting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, individuals
from lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced
stages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid
conditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a
novel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical
deferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment
with three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully
connected layer as the most versatile methodology. We synthesize adversarial,
low-quality images and use contrastive learning to train the deferral system,
guiding the model to identify out-of-distribution samples that warrant
clinician review. By maintaining diagnostic accuracy on suboptimal images and
integrating critical health data, our system can improve early detection,
particularly in underserved populations where advanced DR is often first
identified. This approach may reduce healthcare costs, increase early detection
rates, and address disparities in access to care, promoting healthcare equity.

Abstract: Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and
intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced
video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)
models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,
existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic

dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct
VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models
for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of
real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into
10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering
spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other
critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on
InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained
spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally,
fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance
improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for

have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two
prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling
indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant
content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses
causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps
through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual
grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option
pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These
refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely
retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion
mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The
integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate
accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and
NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially
enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS框架解决了Vision Transformers在HSI数据中解释性的两大挑战，通过类特定光谱提示和可学习的[SINK]令牌，实现了高效且可靠的空间-光谱解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉有意义的光谱线索，且计算成本高，FOCUS旨在填补这一空白，提升HSI决策的可信度。

Method: FOCUS引入类特定光谱提示和[SINK]令牌，通过单次前向传播生成3D显著性图和光谱重要性曲线，无需梯度反向传播或主干修改。

Result: FOCUS提高了波段级IoU 15%，减少注意力崩溃40%以上，结果与专家标注高度一致，参数开销不到1%。

Conclusion: FOCUS为高分辨率ViT解释性提供了实用解决方案，填补了黑盒建模与可信HSI决策之间的长期空白。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous
wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and
environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in
this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing
saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing
attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally
prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI
data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient
spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core
components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward
semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained
with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these
designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps
and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient
backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15
percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency
results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent
parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability
practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing
gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.

*Wenbo Yue,Chang Li,Guoping Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息互补的下采样方法HPD，通过MinMaxPooling替代传统方法，提升语义分割任务中的像素级预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下采样方法可能导致关键空间信息丢失，影响语义分割任务的准确性。

Method: 采用MinMaxPooling提取局部区域的最大值信息，保留图像的明暗对比和细节特征。

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上，HPD的平均DSC系数提高了0.5%。

Conclusion: HPD模块为语义分割任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), downsampling operations are crucial
to model performance. Although traditional downsampling methods (such as
maximum pooling and cross-row convolution) perform well in feature aggregation,
receptive field expansion, and computational reduction, they may lead to the
loss of key spatial information in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby
affecting the pixel-by-pixel prediction accuracy.To this end, this study
proposes a downsampling method based on information complementarity - Hybrid
Pooling Downsampling (HPD). The core is to replace the traditional method with
MinMaxPooling, and effectively retain the light and dark contrast and detail
features of the image by extracting the maximum value information of the local
area.Experiment on various CNN architectures on the ACDC and Synapse datasets
show that HPD outperforms traditional methods in segmentation performance, and
increases the DSC coefficient by 0.5% on average. The results show that the HPD
module provides an efficient solution for semantic segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EPD的新型ODE求解器，通过并行梯度评估减少截断误差，实现高质量、低延迟的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因序列去噪导致高延迟，现有加速方法在低延迟预算下图像质量下降。

Method: EPD通过并行梯度评估优化ODE求解器，参数可学习且训练开销小，可作为插件提升现有采样器。

Result: 在5 NFE的低延迟下，EPD在多个数据集上FID显著优于现有方法，如CIFAR-10上4.47。

Conclusion: EPD在保持低延迟的同时显著提升图像生成质量，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance
but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature.
Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation
under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel
Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates
truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in
each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are
independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.
  Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation
fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.
  In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE
samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and
low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD
achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26
on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant
margin. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/EPD.

TL;DR: 论文评估了DUSt3R、MASt3R和VGGT三种3D重建基础模型在航拍图像上的表现，发现它们能从稀疏图像集（少于10张）中准确重建密集点云，但高分辨率和大图像集时效果下降。

Motivation: 研究这些模型在航拍图像上的潜力，尤其是处理极低图像重叠、遮挡和无纹理区域的能力。

Method: 在UseGeo数据集的航拍图像块上对预训练的DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT模型进行姿态估计和密集3D重建的全面评估。

Result: 这些方法能从稀疏图像集（分辨率最高518像素）重建密集点云，完整性比COLMAP提高50%，VGGT计算效率更高。但高分辨率和大图像集时姿态估计可靠性下降。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法无法完全替代传统SfM和MVS，但在低分辨率、稀疏场景中可作为补充。

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in
handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models
for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction
(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to
handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical
aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,
stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can
accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite
tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric
aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of
the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results
show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very
sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with
completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher
computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose
estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and
large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric
complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully
replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,
especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低级视觉任务多样性带来的统一建模挑战。

Result: 在100多个任务上表现优异，增加任务数量提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: VPIP框架有效、可扩展，为低级视觉任务提供了统一的建模基础。

Abstract: Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image
restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ
significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the
challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual
task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target
image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of
low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing
backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible
integration with various architectures and effective utilization of
task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a
unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across
multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we
extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity.
We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision
tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of
training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited
data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations
through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization,
few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the
model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and
potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general
low-level vision modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度伪造检测方法在单脸场景表现良好，但在多脸社交场景中效果不佳，缺乏对上下文线索的关注。

Method: 通过人类研究识别四种关键线索（场景-运动一致性、脸间外观兼容性、人际注视对齐和脸-身体一致性），并基于此开发了HICOM框架。

Result: HICOM在基准数据集上平均准确率提升3.3%，在真实扰动下提升2.8%，在未见数据集上优于现有方法5.8%。

Conclusion: HICOM通过结合人类认知线索和可解释性设计，为多脸深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often
appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods.
Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in
multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In
this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to
analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of
human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in
social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely
on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal
gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we
introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face
in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that
\textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and
2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods
by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired
cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM
to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more
transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to
enhance defense against deepfakes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来运动轨迹在机器人、自主系统等领域至关重要，但传统视频预测模型计算成本高且推理慢。

Method: 采用深度学习框架，基于单张图像和文本指令预测未来100帧，通过改进InstructPix2Pix模型实现多模态输入。

Result: 在RoboTWin数据集上，SSIM和PSNR优于现有基线，推理更快且GPU需求更低。

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人动作预测中高效且灵活，特别适用于对运动轨迹精度要求高的场景。

Abstract: Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains
such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling
safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,
efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering
significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to
conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation
of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic
tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep
learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will
observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a
textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to
accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame
prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world
scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared
to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike
conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy
computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image
and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,
reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for
applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion
trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型计算密集，资源受限或延迟敏感环境部署困难，现有PTQ方法通用性不足。

Method: 提出SegQuant框架，包含SegLinear（段感知图量化策略）和DualScale（双尺度量化方案）。

Result: SegQuant在Transformer扩散模型外广泛适用，性能强且兼容主流部署工具。

Conclusion: SegQuant为扩散模型量化提供了通用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but
are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an
effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training
quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with
pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However,
existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific
heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with
industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines
complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists
of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures
structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale
quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations,
which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant
is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving
strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream
deployment tools.

structures and domain-specific terminology, remain notably underexplored. We
introduce FinChart-Bench, the first benchmark specifically focused on
real-world financial charts. FinChart-Bench comprises 1,200 financial chart
images collected from 2015 to 2024, each annotated with True/False (TF),
Multiple Choice (MC), and Question Answering (QA) questions, totaling 7,016
questions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LVLMs
on FinChart-Bench. Our evaluation reveals critical insights: (1) the
performance gap between open-source and closed-source models is narrowing, (2)
performance degradation occurs in upgraded models within families, (3) many
models struggle with instruction following, (4) both advanced models show
significant limitations in spatial reasoning abilities, and (5) current LVLMs

Conclusion: PHATNet通过灵活的领域适应方法，有效提升了去雾模型在未见领域上的表现。

Abstract: Image dehazing aims to remove unwanted hazy artifacts in images. Although
previous research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to
improve dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models
often experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world
hazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a
flexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during
testing. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than
recovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network
(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to
source-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to
update dehazing models for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce a Haze-Transfer-Consistency loss and a Content-Leakage Loss to
enhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability. Experimental results demonstrate
that PHATNet significantly boosts state-of-the-art dehazing models on benchmark
real-world image dehazing datasets.

Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images
is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the
high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,
which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there
is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly
used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.
First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to
learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality
of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,
existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding
annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in
supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.
The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation
of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional
diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices
and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training
process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show
that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.
Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus
enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 新方法在减少数据依赖的同时提升了深度补全性能。

Abstract: Depth completion is an important vision task, and many efforts have been made
to enhance the quality of depth maps from sparse depth measurements. Despite
significant advances, training these models to recover dense depth from sparse
measurements remains a challenging problem. Supervised learning methods rely on
dense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised
approaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and
photometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is
costly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised
methods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only
sparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training. Unlike
existing methods, our approach eliminates the need for dense depth labels or
additional images captured from neighboring viewpoints. By leveraging the
characteristics of depth distribution, we design novel loss functions that
effectively propagate depth information from observed points to unobserved
regions. Additionally, we incorporate segmentation maps generated by vision
foundation models to further enhance depth estimation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that
grounds degradation-aware semantic context of video frames in natural language
via foundation models, offering interpretable and flexible guidance. Unlike
prior art, our method assumes no degradation knowledge in train or test time
and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation
model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost.
Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video
restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting,
three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation
benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow
intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We
compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on
all benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架在通用和特定领域检测任务中均具有可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of object detection with a focus on
improving both the localization accuracy of bounding boxes and explicitly
modeling prediction uncertainty. Conventional detectors rely on deterministic
bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model
robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement
framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth
distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter
high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a
simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.
Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively
integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further
extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability
of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks. Code

Abstract: Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the
emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the
fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging
topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not
been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion
states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with
a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the
framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately
designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale
temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion
of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations
for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further
propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges
between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of
body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the
relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an
emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow
architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is
jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing
self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and
achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the
existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of foundation models for depth prediction has
led to remarkable progress, particularly in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their
outputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation
poses challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address
this, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation
models to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as
they require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,
fine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization
capabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,
we introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth
measurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into
metric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,
thereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation
models while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to
bridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional
computational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.

Conclusion: BeatFormer通过结合手工方法和深度学习的优势，提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的rPPG估计解决方案。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) captures cardiac signals from facial
videos and is gaining attention for its diverse applications. While deep
learning has advanced rPPG estimation, it relies on large, diverse datasets for
effective generalization. In contrast, handcrafted methods utilize
physiological priors for better generalization in unseen scenarios like motion
while maintaining computational efficiency. However, their linear assumptions
limit performance in complex conditions, where deep learning provides superior
pulsatile information extraction. This highlights the need for hybrid
approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. To address this, we
present BeatFormer, a lightweight spectral attention model for rPPG estimation,
which integrates zoomed orthonormal complex attention and frequency-domain
energy measurement, enabling a highly efficient model. Additionally, we
introduce Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL), which allows BeatFormer to be
trained without any PPG or HR labels. We validate BeatFormer on the PURE,
UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, demonstrating its robustness and performance,
particularly in cross-dataset evaluations under motion scenarios.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information
in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for
embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on
separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D
point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to
train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP
for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D
encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for
feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training
inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal
network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),
significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal
model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the
tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across
modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module
is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and
images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and
introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.
Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the
three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to
the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by
approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection
task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.

Motivation: 现有方法（如注意力机制或图卷积网络）在图像表示中可能存在噪声且无法精确定位对象，因此需要更精确的语义表示。

Method: 1. 使用标签语义相关特征学习模块提取语义相关特征；2. 设计基于最优传输的注意力机制获取语义对齐的图像表示；3. 采用区域分数聚合策略进行多标签预测。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SARL优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARL通过语义感知表示学习显著提升了多标签图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification, an important research area in computer
vision, focuses on identifying multiple labels or concepts within an image.
Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to learn image representation. However, this representation may
contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper
proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image
classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is
utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based
attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image
representation. Finally, a regional score aggregation strategy is used for
multi-label prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL
VOC 2007 and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of SARL over existing
methods.

Conclusion: \method为实际3D内容生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction showcases advanced
Image-to-3D content creation but requires substantial computational resources
and large datasets, posing challenges to training models from scratch. Current
methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance,
which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds.
To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D
Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using
a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated
point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry
and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS
object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality
reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our
approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and
practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality
outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D
content generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多维尺度分析（MDS）的稳健方法，用于冷冻电镜中的姿态估计和位移校正，通过鲁棒优化和迭代位移校正算法提高3D重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜中极低的信噪比（SNR）导致姿态估计和位移校正困难，直接影响3D重建的准确性。

Method: 利用MDS技术从二面角对估计3D旋转矩阵，通过鲁棒联合优化框架（ℓ1范数目标）和迭代位移校正算法实现。

Result: 在欧拉角精度和重建保真度（通过FSC测量）上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过鲁棒优化和精确约束，显著提升了低信噪比条件下的姿态估计和重建质量。

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM
due to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D
reconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that
leverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to
estimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.
We express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit
vector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the
concept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common
line estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM
projection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary
components: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based
on an $\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously
estimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm
and orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an
iterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane
translations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches
have leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation
recovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\ell_2$-based objectives
that are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only
approximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,
can lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR
regimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler
angle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell
Correlation (FSC).

Result: 在三个医学数据集和十一个基线方法的评估中，该方法在预测性能上表现最佳，并提供可解释的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该概率框架不仅提升了预测性能，还通过不确定性图增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of
attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL
methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide
images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training.
Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating
instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the
bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions
among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various
mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially
overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this
work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability
distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local
interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven}
state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our
approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover,
the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are
interpretable in terms of illness localization.

Conclusion: MICU方法通过结合对比学习和自监督学习，显著提升了模型在开放集跨模态任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper extends Cross Modal Generalization (CMG) to open-set environments
by proposing the more challenging Open-set Cross Modal Generalization (OSCMG)
task. This task evaluates multimodal unified representations in open-set
conditions, addressing the limitations of prior closed-set cross-modal
evaluations. OSCMG requires not only cross-modal knowledge transfer but also
robust generalization to unseen classes within new modalities, a scenario
frequently encountered in real-world applications. Existing multimodal unified
representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle
this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked
multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI
enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic
semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization.
CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating
modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby
strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set
tasks. Extensive experiments on CMG and the newly proposed OSCMG validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

Motivation: 嵌入式设备上的实时多标签视频分类受限于计算和能源预算，但视频流的结构特性（如标签稀疏性、时间连续性和标签共现性）可被用于高效推理。

Method: Polymorph框架动态选择和组合轻量级LoRA适配器，每个适配器专注于由共现模式生成的子类，避免全模型切换和权重合并。

Result: 在TAO数据集上，Polymorph能耗降低40%，mAP提升9个百分点。

Conclusion: Polymorph通过模块化策略显著提升了嵌入式设备上的视频分类效率和性能。

Abstract: Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained
by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural
properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence
that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a
context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank
Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes
derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a
shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only
the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching
and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing
latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption
and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset.

Conclusion: 本文提出的深度学习框架为低重叠PCR任务提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了配准性能。

Abstract: Low-overlap point cloud registration (PCR) remains a significant challenge in
3D vision. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as Maximum Inlier Count, become
ineffective under extremely low inlier ratios. In this paper, we revisit the
registration result evaluation problem and identify the Decision version of the
PCR task as the fundamental problem. To address this Decision PCR task, we
propose a data-driven approach. First, we construct a corresponding dataset
based on the 3DMatch dataset. Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained
to reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of
traditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to
address this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this
classifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,
existing state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced
registration performance. For example, combining our framework with
GeoTransformer achieves a new SOTA registration recall of 86.97\% on the
challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark. Our method also demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities on the unseen outdoor ETH dataset.

Result: 在四项任务的11个基准测试中，HiCroPL表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HiCroPL通过分层跨模态交互有效提升了模型的泛化能力，为视觉语言模型的适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent
generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to
downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains
challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer
from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality
isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,
we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that
establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,
enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge
flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early
layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts
through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of
low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific
task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper
alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations
at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain
transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further
introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient
cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate
HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11
benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 语义提示信息对多模态回归任务至关重要，RvTC方法显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based
regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods
fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts
(e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating
behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over
image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts
perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic
understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based
Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification
with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address
discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates
manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only
images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts
dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts
containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage
cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to
prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We
demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that
MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical
biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual
context in multimodal regression tasks.

Conclusion: 轴对齐几何约束和预处理策略有效提升了文档去扭曲的性能。

Abstract: Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing
learning-based methods primarily rely on supervised regression with annotated
data without leveraging the inherent geometric properties in physical documents
to the dewarping process. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is
characterized by transforming distorted feature lines into axis-aligned ones.
This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid
geometry in planar documents. In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned
geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we
propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping
difficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned
Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with
human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,
our method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves
18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric.

Abstract: Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in
computer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has
significantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high
memory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in
real-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything
(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM
often generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.
Therefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline
curve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the
robust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a
four-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed
to effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the
visual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising
critical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical
utility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential
for FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial
automation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and
efficient edge recognition is crucial.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Video Thinking Test (Video-TT)，用于评估视频大语言模型在理解和解释真实世界视频时与人类智能的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分反映视频大语言模型在正确性和鲁棒性方面与人类智能的差距。

Method: 通过构建包含1,000个YouTube Shorts视频的数据集，每个视频配有一个开放式问题和四个对抗性问题，评估模型的视觉和叙事理解能力。

Result: 评估结果显示视频大语言模型与人类表现之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Video-TT揭示了视频大语言模型在复杂视觉叙事理解和对抗性问题上的不足。

Abstract: Human intelligence requires correctness and robustness, with the former being
foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the
accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent
performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language
models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between
these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness
in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to
assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.
Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and
evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises
1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four
adversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our
evaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.

Motivation: 传统波动方程数值求解器计算量大且不稳定，限制了准实时图像重建的应用；现有神经算子数据集过于简化，无法满足实际成像需求。

Method: 提出OpenBreastUS数据集，包含8,000个解剖学真实的人体乳腺模型和1,600万频域波模拟，基于真实USCT配置。

Result: 首次展示了使用神经算子求解器实现人体乳腺的高效体内成像。

Conclusion: OpenBreastUS为开发创新神经PDE求解器提供了平台，并推动了其在现实医学成像问题中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in
computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography
(USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered
waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally
intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for
quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative
approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their
effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets
oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a
large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between
theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes
8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million
frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a
comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward
simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,
scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and
extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing
innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in
real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate
efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像增强对海洋保护（如珊瑚礁监测）至关重要，但现有AI模型存在数据集偏差、高计算成本和透明度不足的问题，可能导致误判。

Method: EBA-AI利用CLIP嵌入检测和缓解数据集偏差，并通过自适应处理优化能耗，减少GPU使用。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，EBA-AI在PSNR略微下降（1.0 dB）的同时，显著节省计算资源，支持实时大规模监测。

Conclusion: EBA-AI在效率、公平性和可解释性方面优于现有方法，为可持续、无偏且高效的水下图像处理提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement is vital for marine conservation, particularly
coral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset
bias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential
misinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware
AI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to
detect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across
varied underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to
optimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining
competitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100
show that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable
real-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,
uncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven
environmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,
WaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing
efficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing. By
addressing key limitations of AI-driven enhancement, this work contributes to
sustainable, bias-aware, and computationally efficient marine conservation
efforts. For interactive visualizations, animations, source code, and access to

Motivation: 解决现有虚拟试穿技术中监督方法泛化能力差和无监督方法数据偏差大的问题。

Method: 提出服装先验生成机制和连续边界缝合技术以保留细节，利用DDIM反演实现精确姿势对齐。

Result: 在多样化数据集和场景中表现优异，首次实现多人虚拟试穿。

Conclusion: OmniVTON通过解耦服装和姿势约束，克服了扩散模型的偏差，成为首个跨场景通用的虚拟试穿解决方案。

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) techniques rely on either supervised
in-shop approaches, which ensure high fidelity but struggle with cross-domain
generalization, or unsupervised in-the-wild methods, which improve adaptability
but remain constrained by data biases and limited universality. A unified,
training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open
challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON
framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture
fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment
details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing
with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve
fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM
inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,
ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By
disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias
inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance
across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it
is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment
transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene. Code is available at

Motivation: 针对当前全色锐化模型复杂、计算开销大且泛化能力差的问题，提出轻量化解决方案。

Method: 设计PanTiny框架，采用多数据集联合训练和复合损失函数优化模型性能。

Result: PanTiny在效率和性能上优于大型专用模型，显著提升全分辨率数据的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过模型设计、训练范式和损失函数的优化，轻量化模型可超越复杂模型，推动全色锐化领域向高效、通用化发展。

Abstract: The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly
large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets.
This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor
generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper.
In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step
pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance.
More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a
single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite
datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral
information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only
simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on
full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite
loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for
pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny
model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior
performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized
models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled
engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass
brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards
creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for
pan-sharpening. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体图像动画扩散模型在参考图像和驱动视频差异较大时难以保持身份一致性，因此需要一种无需后处理即可生成高质量视频的解决方案。

Method: StableAnimator++ 结合了可学习的姿态对齐模块（基于SVD）、全局内容感知的人脸编码器和分布感知的ID适配器，并在推理阶段引入了基于HJB的人脸优化。

Result: 实验证明，StableAnimator++ 在定性和定量上均表现出色，显著提升了身份一致性。

Conclusion: StableAnimator++ 是一种高效的身份一致性保持框架，为人体图像动画生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain
identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving
video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce
StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with
learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned
on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building
upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed
modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In
particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the
similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven
poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These
matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating
misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face
embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a
global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a
distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal
layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference
stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization
integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for
enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of
StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨生成模型是否能掌握文本图像生成和编辑的复杂性，并将其作为通用生成模型的基础技能。

Method: 通过33个代表性任务（分为五类）评估六种模型，使用定制的高质量图像输入和提示。

Result: 研究揭示了当前生成模型在OCR任务中的弱点，并提出了关键观察。

Conclusion: 结论认为，逼真的文本图像生成和编辑应作为通用生成模型的基础技能，而非依赖专用解决方案。

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.

Result: LASED训练模型召回率显著提升，可转向CNN比传统CNN平均提高12%召回率。

Conclusion: 结合大规模数据集和可转向CNN，显著增强了无人机vPR的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.

Motivation: ESD术中出血的实时定位和监测需求迫切，但现有AI方法仅关注出血区域分割，缺乏对出血源检测和动态跟踪的研究。

Method: 引入BleedOrigin-Bench数据集和BleedOrigin-Net框架，结合检测与跟踪技术，优化出血源定位流程。

Result: BleedOrigin-Net在出血起始检测、初始源定位和点跟踪方面均达到先进水平，准确率分别为96.85%、70.24%和96.11%。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了ESD出血源检测的空白，为AI辅助手术提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the
embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the
classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic
visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is
designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an
index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction
quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep
learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is

Conclusion: VideoPlan通过创新方法有效解决了视觉规划中的关键挑战，并在多个任务中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made
available.

Motivation: 事件传感器数据稀疏且异步，传统方法将其转换为密集张量会丧失优势，而现有图表示方法对时空动态建模不足。

Method: 构建解耦的空间图（B样条基函数建模全局结构）和时间图（运动向量注意力建模局部动态变化），替代昂贵的3D核。

Result: 在Gen1和eTraM数据集上，检测精度提升6%，速度提升5倍，参数减少，计算成本不变。

Conclusion: 结构化图建模有效提升了异步视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results
highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous
vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.

Conclusion: MeshMamba及其衍生模型在3D人体网格生成和重建任务中表现出高效性和扩展性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MeshMamba, a neural network model for learning 3D
articulated mesh models by employing the recently proposed Mamba State Space
Models (Mamba-SSMs). MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large
number of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh
models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,
while achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes
will be released soon in public.

Abstract: Advancements in 3D vision have increased the impact of blood vessel modeling
on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful
application of a part-based generative approach for 3D vessel modeling, setting
a new benchmark for vascular data generation. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的可解释性方法，应用于乳腺影像分析，通过分析预训练的视觉-语言基础模型Mammo-CLIP，揭示了与临床相关概念（如肿块和可疑钙化）相关的潜在特征。


<details>

Motivation: 在医疗影像等高风险领域，模型决策的可解释性对临床采用至关重要。本研究旨在通过SAE方法深入理解乳腺影像基础模型的内部工作机制。

Method: 训练了一个基于Mammo-CLIP的patch级稀疏自编码器（Mammo-SAE），用于识别和探测与临床相关乳腺概念相关的潜在特征。

Result: 研究发现，SAE潜在空间中激活度最高的神经元通常与真实区域对齐，并揭示了影响模型决策的混杂因素。此外，还分析了模型在下游微调中依赖的潜在神经元。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可解释的SAE潜在表征为乳腺影像基础模型的内部工作机制提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Interpretability is critical in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging,
where understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this
work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast
imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model
pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast
concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE
latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings
of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.

Motivation: 解决跨域少样本学习中因参数过多导致过拟合的问题，并提升模型对新域样本的适应能力。

Method: 提出Coalescent Projection（CP）替代软提示，结合伪类生成方法和自监督变换（SSTs）优化模型。

Result: 在BSCD-FSL基准测试的极端域偏移场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: CP和SSTs方法有效解决了过拟合问题，提升了模型在新域中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model
pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the
latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that
updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the
extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published

Result: 实验表明，FreeCus在零样本主题合成中表现优异，兼容现有修复和控制模块。

Conclusion: FreeCus成功激活扩散变换器的零样本能力，为高质量主题驱动合成提供了无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

Motivation: 传统微分PnP在图像到点云（I2P）注册中对噪声和异常值敏感，影响了对应学习的有效性。

Method: 提出MinCD-PnP方法，简化盲PnP为最小化Chamfer距离的任务，并设计轻量级多任务学习模块MinCD-Net。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，MinCD-Net在跨场景和跨数据集设置中均优于现有方法，提高了内点比率（IR）和注册召回率（RR）。

Conclusion: MinCD-PnP方法显著提升了I2P注册的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.

Motivation: 利用条件扩散模型在人类视觉感知对齐重建方面的优势，优化视频压缩的感知质量。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：多粒度条件捕捉静态和动态信息；紧凑表示高效传输；多条件训练增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在FVD和LPIPS等感知质量指标上显著优于传统和神经编解码器，尤其在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型为视频压缩提供了感知优化的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at
reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLM）在生物识别系统中检测物理和数字攻击的应用，提出了一种上下文学习框架，无需大量训练数据即可实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物识别系统的发展，攻击技术日益复杂，传统深度学习模型在适应新攻击类型和环境条件时表现不佳，且数据收集面临隐私和多样性挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于VLM的上下文学习框架，用于检测物理呈现攻击和数字变形攻击，并通过开源模型进行定量评估。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在物理和数字攻击检测中表现优异，优于传统CNN，且无需资源密集型训练。

Conclusion: 该框架为提高攻击检测的泛化能力提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the
detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection
methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks
on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.

Conclusion: DMD方法在指纹识别中具有高效性和泛化能力，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental
challenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance
in such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense
representation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and
discriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.
Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding
code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Yy/DMD.

Motivation: 当前少样本目标检测方法在有限训练样本下难以准确提取有效特征，高权重通道未必有效，低权重通道可能仍有价值。

Method: 设计了SCSM模块，包含空间特征建模（SFM）和基于Mamba的通道状态建模（CSM），以平衡空间与通道关系并学习通道相关性。

Result: 在VOC和COCO数据集上的实验表明，SCSM模块提升了特征表示质量，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SCSM模块通过建模通道相关性，有效提升了少样本目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse
applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.

Conclusion: ExDD通过双分布建模和合成数据生成，显著提升了工业缺陷检测的性能，解决了数据稀缺和异常分布假设问题。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.

high variability in defect appearances across different road conditions. We
propose RoadFusion, a framework that addresses these limitations through
synthetic anomaly generation with dual-path feature adaptation. A latent

Abstract: The state of the art in human-centric computer vision achieves high accuracy
and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction
tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground
segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and
inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our
human-centric synthetic dataset and trained models are available at

Conclusion: ORSANet通过多模态引导和动态损失设计，显著提升了遮挡条件下的FER性能，为相关研究提供了新工具和数据集。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER
demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX

Abstract: Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAda的简单有效方法，通过动态校准视觉语言模型（VLM）中融合表示的贡献，提升零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独优化文本或视觉表示，而忽略了融合表示在决策中的关键作用。

Method: RAda利用轻量级注意力层学习掩码，动态调整融合表示中各元素的贡献，无需修改中间特征。

Result: 在不同设置下（如更新或冻结预训练编码器），RAda表现优异，优于基线方法并与当前最佳方法相当。

Conclusion: RAda是一种通用的微调技术，能有效提升视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该数据集为复杂环境下的异常检测提供了基准，支持未来研究和实际应用。

Abstract: After a family murder in rural Germany, authorities failed to locate the
suspect in a vast forest despite a massive search. To aid the search, a
research aircraft captured high-resolution aerial imagery. Due to dense
vegetation obscuring small clues, automated analysis was ineffective, prompting
a crowd-search initiative. This effort produced a unique dataset of labeled,
hard-to-detect anomalies under occluded, real-world conditions. It can serve as
a benchmark for improving anomaly detection approaches in complex forest
environments, supporting manhunts and rescue operations. Initial benchmark
tests showed existing methods performed poorly, highlighting the need for
context-aware approaches. The dataset is openly accessible for offline
processing. An additional interactive web interface supports online viewing and
dynamic growth by allowing users to annotate and submit new findings.

Abstract: Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and

LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our
method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images
through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction
network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware
representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine
flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our
hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively,
ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities.
Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our
approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.

TL;DR: GeMix是一种基于类条件GAN的两阶段图像增强框架，通过生成视觉连贯的图像替代传统像素级混合，提升医学图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mixup的像素级插值在医学等高风险应用中可能生成不真实图像，影响学习效果。

Method: 使用StyleGAN2-ADA生成器，通过Dirichlet和Beta分布采样标签向量，生成连续类流形上的图像。

Result: 在COVIDx-CT-3数据集上，GeMix结合真实数据显著提升分类性能，降低COVID-19检测的假阴性率。

Conclusion: GeMix可作为传统Mixup的直接替代，提供更强的正则化和语义保真度，且不破坏现有训练流程。

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.

TL;DR: UMIVR是一个基于不确定性最小化的交互式文本到视频检索框架，通过量化文本模糊性、映射不确定性和帧不确定性，生成针对性问题以优化查询效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互式文本到视频检索方法缺乏对不确定性的量化，限制了其效果。

Method: UMIVR使用语义熵（TAS）、Jensen-Shannon散度（MUS）和时序质量采样器（TQFS）量化不确定性，并生成针对性问题。

Result: 在MSR-VTT-1k数据集上，UMIVR在10轮交互后Recall@1达到69.2%。

Conclusion: UMIVR为交互式文本到视频检索提供了不确定性最小化的基础，显著提升了检索效果。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对信息完整性和社会信任构成挑战，现有检测方法模型庞大且机制不透明，难以在资源有限环境中部署。

Method: 应用彩票假设（LTH）进行深度伪造检测，通过迭代幅度剪枝识别关键子网络，并在MesoNet、CNN-5和ResNet-18架构上进行实验。

Result: MesoNet在80%稀疏度下保持56.2%准确率（基线为62.6%），LTH方法优于一次性剪枝，且关键面部区域仍被关注。

Conclusion: LTH方法可高效剪枝深度伪造检测网络，保持性能，且子网络具有跨数据集可迁移性，适合资源有限环境部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.

Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在非均匀光照场景（如背光和阴影）中表现不佳，导致过曝或亮度恢复不足。

Method: 提出动态积分图像表示建模空间变化光照，构建SAI²E估计器，并引入光照引导的多头自注意力机制（IG-MSA）。

Result: 在五个标准低光数据集和跨域基准（LOL-Blur）上显著优于现有方法，尤其在非均匀光照增强中表现优异。

Conclusion: SAIGFormer在光照恢复和泛化能力上均优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have made promising
progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves
superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets. Code is available

Motivation: 现有程序学习方法在顺序变化、冗余帧和重复动作上表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 采用融合Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输和结构先验的方法，并加入对比正则化以避免退化解。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了程序学习中的关键问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于AI的点云压缩方法依赖特定训练数据分布，限制了实际应用；INR方法虽解决了分布依赖问题，但仅支持有损压缩。

Method: 设计了点云级编码框架和高效网络初始化策略，减少60%编码时间；提出基于多尺度SparseConv的轻量级编码网络，实现快速推理和小解码器尺寸。

Result: 实验显示，LINR-PCGC在MVUB数据集上比G-PCC TMC13v23和SparsePCGC分别减少21.21%和21.95%的比特流。

Conclusion: LINR-PCGC是首个基于INR的无损点云几何压缩方法，显著优于传统和AI方法，具有高效编码和紧凑解码器优势。

Abstract: Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

Result: 实验证明，这些关键元素对手术场景理解（如安全视野评估和动作三元组识别）有显著贡献。

Conclusion: 整合工具-动作-目标组合和手部身份能有效提升手术场景图表示的性能。

Abstract: Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 解决现有方法在零样本HOI检测中难以区分相同对象的不同动作或泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 通过低秩分解VLM文本特征，生成类共享基特征和可调权重，结合LLM的动作正则化指导权重适应。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，未见动词设置下达到27.91的mAP，刷新了零样本HOI检测的最新记录。

Conclusion: HOLa通过低秩分解和特征适应，显著提升了零样本HOI检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging
task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address
this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中难以有效整合时空信息，尤其是快速移动物体的空间信息容易因运动模糊等问题被忽视，导致时空交互不准确。

Method: 提出DynImg方法，利用非关键帧作为时间提示，引导模型关注快速移动物体的细粒度空间特征，并采用4D视频旋转位置嵌入保持时空顺序。

Result: 实验表明，DynImg在多个视频理解基准上比现有最优方法提升了约2%。

Conclusion: DynImg通过时间提示和4D嵌入，有效提升了视频理解的性能，解决了快速移动物体空间信息提取不足的问题。

Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.

Result: 实验显示在低功耗硬件上实现0.7 Mpixel/s的吞吐量，F1分数表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现卫星上端到端变化检测，为实时应用提供可行方案。

Abstract: Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.

disease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of
skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring
patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation
model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on
low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the
generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of
standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking
datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving
state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes
the proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work
advances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical
image analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare
professionals. The code is made publicly available at

TL;DR: Being-H0是一种基于人类视频训练的灵巧视觉-语言-动作模型，通过物理指令调优和新颖的运动标记化方法，解决了现有模型在复杂操作任务中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型在复杂操作任务中表现不佳，主要依赖合成数据或有限规模的遥操作演示，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出物理指令调优范式，结合大规模人类视频预训练、物理空间对齐和机器人任务后适应，并引入毫米级精度的运动标记化方法。

Result: Being-H0在手部运动生成和指令跟随方面表现优异，且在真实机器人操作任务中展现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过物理指令调优和大规模多样化数据，Being-H0显著提升了复杂操作任务的性能，并展示了良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We
empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and
instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.
Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic
manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied. More details are

TL;DR: ConformalSAM利用基础分割模型SEEM生成未标注数据的预测掩码，并通过不确定性校准和自依赖训练策略提升半监督语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决像素级视觉任务中标注数据稀缺的问题，利用基础分割模型作为标注工具。

Method: 提出ConformalSAM框架，结合不确定性校准和自依赖训练策略，优化SEEM生成的掩码质量。

Result: 在三个标准基准测试中，ConformalSAM性能优于现有方法，并可作为插件提升其他方法。

Conclusion: ConformalSAM通过可靠利用基础模型和动态调整训练策略，有效解决了半监督语义分割中的标注稀缺问题。

Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了SDF和3DGS的优势，提升了稀疏视图下的重建和渲染性能。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction and novel view rendering from sparse-view images are
challenging. Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods struggle with fine
details, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches lack global
geometry coherence. We propose a novel hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance
3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details
of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses
state-of-the-art approaches in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis
on the DTU and MobileBrick datasets. Code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力重分配（DARA）方法和TrueMICL数据集，以解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在上下文学习中过度依赖文本而忽视视觉信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在多模态上下文学习（MICL）中倾向于忽视视觉信息，仅依赖文本模式，导致性能受限且难以评估。

Method: 提出DARA方法，通过重新平衡视觉和文本标记的注意力，并构建TrueMICL数据集，要求模型整合多模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在多模态上下文学习中的能力。

Conclusion: DARA和TrueMICL为解决MLLMs在MICL中的视觉信息利用不足问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于圆柱坐标系的CylinderPlane表示方法，解决了Tri-plane表示中的多视角一致性问题，实现了高质量、无伪影的360°图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tri-plane表示在对称区域共享特征导致多面伪影，限制了360°视图图像的生成能力。

Method: 采用圆柱坐标系明确分离不同角度的特征，并引入嵌套圆柱表示以处理复杂几何和多分辨率。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实图像上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CylinderPlane解决了Tri-plane的局限性，适用于多种神经渲染管道。

Abstract: While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著减少标注样本的情况下，能达到与全监督训练相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 在特定手稿中，基于不确定性的AL效果不佳，需探索更适合数据稀缺场景的方法。

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is a cornerstone of music digitization
initiatives in cultural heritage, yet it remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,
uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in
data-scarcity scenarios.

Motivation: 当前视频对象分割方法依赖外观匹配，缺乏人类对对象的概念理解能力，导致在视觉变化、遮挡和复杂场景变化中表现不佳。

Method: SeC框架利用大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）构建对象的概念先验，结合语义推理和特征匹配，动态调整计算资源。

Result: SeC在SeCVOS基准测试中比SAM 2.1提升了11.8个百分点，实现了概念感知视频对象分割的新最优性能。

Conclusion: SeC通过概念驱动的分割方法，显著提升了复杂场景下的视频对象分割能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉识别和语言理解方面取得了进展，但仍存在对象幻觉问题，即模型生成看似合理但实际错误的输出。研究发现先验知识在深层抑制视觉信息，但中间层的抑制机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出EVA方法，动态选择中间层提取视觉事实信息，通过对比原始输入和纯文本输入的输出分布，修正最终层的输出。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，EVA显著降低了幻觉率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EVA是一种模型无关、无需训练的方法，能有效减少MLLMs中的幻觉现象，适用于多种解码策略和模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a core task in computer vision. Multimodal
methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated
exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of
excessive parameter burden and insufficient ability to identify local distorted
features in CLIP for IQA, this study proposes a visual-language model knowledge
distillation method aimed at guiding the training of models with architectural
advantages using CLIP's IQA knowledge. First, quality-graded prompt templates
were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned
to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple
IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly
reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.

Motivation: 现有视觉重定位方法在精度和计算效率之间存在固有矛盾，尤其是在大规模遥感场景中，这些问题更为突出。

Method: 采用3DGS作为场景表示，提出双层次框架（稀疏到密集、粗到细），结合分区高斯训练、GPU并行匹配和动态内存管理策略。

Result: 在仿真数据、公开数据集和实际飞行实验中，方法表现出较高的定位精度、召回率和计算效率。

Conclusion: $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc有效解决了遥感场景中的视觉重定位问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.

Motivation: 稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在重建高质量新视图时容易过拟合高频细节，现有基于傅里叶变换的频率正则化方法参数调优困难且偏向有害的高频学习。

Method: 提出DWTGS框架，利用小波空间损失提供额外的空间监督，仅监督低频LL子带，并以自监督方式对高频HH子带施加稀疏性。

Result: 实验表明，DWTGS在多个基准测试中优于基于傅里叶的方法，低频中心策略提高了泛化能力并减少了高频幻觉。

Conclusion: DWTGS通过小波变换的频率正则化方法，有效解决了稀疏视图3DGS的高频过拟合问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，适用于实际场景中的人脸图像质量评估。

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

Method: 在ImageNet上进行了扩散模型、流模型和自回归模型的对比实验，提出了控制令牌预填充基线方法，并研究了采样时间增强技术。

Result: 控制令牌预填充表现优异，采样时间增强技术显著提升了控制与生成的一致性。适配器方法在有限数据下表现良好，但一致性不如全训练。

Abstract: Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: TokensGen通过令牌和预训练短视频模型，为长视频生成提供了可扩展的模块化解决方案，适用于影视制作和沉浸式模拟。

Abstract: Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的方法，通过预测空间自适应双边网格来校正多视角下的光度变化，无需场景特定重训练，提高了3D高斯泼溅管线的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代相机管线中的处理（如曝光调整、白平衡等）会导致多视角间的光度不一致，影响新视角合成的质量。现有方法通过联合优化场景表示和每图像外观嵌入来解决，但计算复杂度高且训练慢。

Method: 采用Transformer预测空间自适应双边网格，校正光度变化，并与3D高斯泼溅管线结合，实现高效训练和高质量重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建保真度和收敛速度上优于或匹配现有场景特定优化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多视角一致性校正和跨场景泛化方面表现优异，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HDF的新框架，通过两个模块增强时间频率建模并优化样本不平衡问题，显著提升了动态面部表情识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Motivation: 现有方法在多源数据和个体表达变异性导致的样本异质性下性能下降，需解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了时间频率分布注意力模块（DAM）和分布感知缩放模块（DSM），分别用于增强时间频率建模和动态平衡分类与对比损失。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k数据集上，HDF显著提高了识别准确性和鲁棒性，取得了优越的WAR和UAR。

Conclusion: HDF框架有效解决了样本异质性和优化不平衡问题，具有广泛适用性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中现有方法对所有错误同等惩罚，未能利用标签空间的语义关系，尤其在标签复杂时效果不佳。

Method: 提出两种树基语义损失函数，结合层次化标签结构，并扩展至稀疏标注场景。

Result: 在全脑分割和神经外科高光谱成像任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 树基语义损失函数能有效利用标签层次结构，提升医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next
generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art
performance in both cases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整低秩适应（LoRA）中固有秩的新方法，用于医学图像分割，通过引入L1稀疏正则化器自动优化秩选择，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法需要固定秩，难以适应医学图像任务的复杂性和多样性，因此需要一种动态调整秩的方法。

Method: 通过将低秩表示视为奇异值分解，引入L1稀疏正则化器，并使用近端优化器自动优化秩选择。

Result: 在少量样本微调设置中，该方法显著优于标准LoRA和其他PEFT方法，表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态调整秩的方法在医学图像分割中具有显著优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly
available: https://github.com/ghassenbaklouti/ARENA

Abstract: The paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art low-parameter deep
neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.
These findings contribute to more efficient and scalable neural networks for
the low-parameter range and advance the understanding of bottlenecks in
computer vision. https://caiac.pubpub.org/pub/3dh6rsel

Method: 提出对扩散后验采样方法的改进，包括噪声污染的似然近似，并测试其在多元地质场景中的性能。

Result: 相比原始方法，统计稳健性显著提升，后验概率密度采样更优，计算成本降低。

Conclusion: 改进的扩散模型方法适用于硬数据和间接数据，反演速度更快，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型在物理常识方面表现不足，常违反因果关系和对象行为等基本物理规则。

Method: 提出PhysVidBench基准，包括精心设计的提示和三阶段评估流程（问题生成、视频字幕、语言模型回答）。

Result: 通过间接评估策略，避免了直接视频评估中的幻觉问题，突出了工具使用和材料属性等关键领域。

Conclusion: PhysVidBench为生成视频模型的物理常识评估提供了结构化、可解释的框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis
of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,
interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video
models.

Motivation: 现代生成模型共享类似的目标——从噪声输入（如高斯噪声或掩码）中重建干净信号，即去噪过程。作者希望通过对齐分词器嵌入与去噪目标，提升生成模型的性能。

Method: 提出了Latent Denoising Tokenizer (l-DeTok)，通过训练分词器从被插值噪声和随机掩码污染的潜在嵌入中重建干净图像。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上的实验表明，l-DeTok在六种代表性生成模型中均优于标准分词器。

Conclusion: 去噪是分词器设计的基本原则，未来分词器设计可基于此展开。

Abstract: Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.

Result: 实验表明，DeepWriter在金融报告生成中优于现有基线，生成内容的事实准确性和质量更高。

Conclusion: DeepWriter通过离线知识库和多模态检索，显著提升了专业领域写作的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various applications. However, their use as writing assistants in specialized
domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep
domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,
such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency
across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often
degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we
introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant
that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a
novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal
retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining
information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual
elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and
professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge
representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on
financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,
verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and
generated content quality.

Result: 编辑后的知识在微调过程中更容易被遗忘，冻结相关层可显著提升知识保留。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法在微调下的鲁棒性存在局限，未来编辑方法需考虑冻结相关层以提高稳定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often
requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired
information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as
efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge
modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training.
In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream
tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge
remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how
different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing
techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more
susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired
through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current
editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under
downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further
find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly
improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods
might be made more robust.

Conclusion: SMACS证明了开源LLMs协作的潜力，推动了智能上限。

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source
collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple
open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this,
we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework
with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and
generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior
Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select
the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose
an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the
generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the
high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight
mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating
fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,
e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)
across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results
of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source
LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence. Code will be released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户很少阅读隐私政策，但需要了解其数据使用情况，以保护隐私。

Method: 结合NLP提取政策文本的正式表示，并通过逻辑推理比较用户偏好与政策内容。

Result: PoliAnalyzer在大多数任务中F1-score达90-100%，能识别95.2%无冲突的政策内容。

Conclusion: PoliAnalyzer支持大规模自动化隐私政策分析，帮助用户重获数据控制权。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites despite claiming
otherwise. This paper introduces PoliAnalyzer, a neuro-symbolic system that
assists users with personalized privacy policy analysis. PoliAnalyzer uses
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract formal representations of data
usage practices from policy texts. In favor of deterministic, logical inference
is applied to compare user preferences with the formal privacy policy
representation and produce a compliance report. To achieve this, we extend an
existing formal Data Terms of Use policy language to model privacy policies as
app policies and user preferences as data policies. In our evaluation using our
enriched PolicyIE dataset curated by legal experts, PoliAnalyzer demonstrated
high accuracy in identifying relevant data usage practices, achieving F1-score
of 90-100% across most tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how PoliAnalyzer can
model diverse user data-sharing preferences, derived from prior research as 23
user profiles, and perform compliance analysis against the top 100 most-visited
websites. This analysis revealed that, on average, 95.2% of a privacy policy's
segments do not conflict with the analyzed user preferences, enabling users to
concentrate on understanding the 4.8% (636 / 13205) that violates preferences,
significantly reducing cognitive burden. Further, we identified common
practices in privacy policies that violate user expectations - such as the
sharing of location data with 3rd parties. This paper demonstrates that
PoliAnalyzer can support automated personalized privacy policy analysis at
scale using off-the-shelf NLP tools. This sheds light on a pathway to help
individuals regain control over their data and encourage societal discussions
on platform data practices to promote a fairer power dynamic.

DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized
(BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed
on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity
through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate
that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an
F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical
results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture
meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the
critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In
addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers
an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study
offers actionable insights for model selection in mental health NLP
applications and validates the potential of contextualized language models to
support early bipolar disorder screening.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在用户交互应用中会根据用户的身份标记（如种族、性别、年龄）产生偏见，导致医疗、法律、薪资等领域的决策差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM如何利用用户文本中的身份信息进行决策，并评估其在现实应用中的潜在危害。

Method: 对五个高风险领域的LLM应用（医疗、法律、政治、政府福利、薪资）进行全面分析，研究身份标记对模型响应的影响。

Result: LLM对用户身份标记极为敏感，导致医疗标准、薪资建议和政治观点等方面的偏见。

Conclusion: 使用现成的LLM可能引发有害差异，建议在部署前进行全面评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in user-facing
applications, from providing medical consultations to job interview advice.
Recent research suggests that these models are becoming increasingly proficient
at inferring identity information about the author of a piece of text from
linguistic patterns as subtle as the choice of a few words. However, little is
known about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in
real-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how
identity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five
different high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,
politics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are
extremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,
gender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For
instance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different
standards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same
symptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a
conservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by
older (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for
non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken
together, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these
applications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps,
and create different political factual realities for people of different
identities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for
evaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts
model decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend
that similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are
conducted before future deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出CCL-XCoT框架，通过两阶段微调减少多语言大模型在低资源语言中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言中容易产生幻觉（如不准确或虚构的输出），这是由于训练数据不平衡导致的。

Method: 1. 基于课程的对比学习增强跨语言语义对齐；2. 在指令微调阶段引入跨语言思维链（XCoT）提示策略。

Result: CCL-XCoT将幻觉率降低高达62%，显著提升跨语言事实知识迁移。

Conclusion: CCL-XCoT有效减少幻觉，无需依赖外部检索或多模型集成。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization
across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in
low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations,
which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in
domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this
challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based
Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for
mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual
semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with
next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this
foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting
strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a
high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource
language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates
by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across
language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict
sequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks,
such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation.
However, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying
advanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets.
This creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and
datasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular
platforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no
sign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained
models, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or
malicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical
to understand the origin and development of these components to better detect
potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by
this, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,
which are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to
systematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a
directed heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and
datasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We
then perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the
LLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree
distribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented
periphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong
interdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is
dynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best with well-crafted prompts, yet
prompt engineering remains manual, inconsistent, and inaccessible to
non-experts. We introduce Promptomatix, an automatic prompt optimization
framework that transforms natural language task descriptions into high-quality
prompts without requiring manual tuning or domain expertise. Promptomatix
supports both a lightweight meta-prompt-based optimizer and a DSPy-powered
compiler, with modular design enabling future extension to more advanced
frameworks. The system analyzes user intent, generates synthetic training data,
selects prompting strategies, and refines prompts using cost-aware objectives.
Evaluated across 5 task categories, Promptomatix achieves competitive or
superior performance compared to existing libraries, while reducing prompt
length and computational overhead making prompt optimization scalable and

Conclusion: ChartScope通过创新方法解决了现有局限性，并建立了新的评估基准。

Abstract: Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for
domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart
comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First,
they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization
to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for
chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying
data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth
chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data
generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart
types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model
to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning
capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we
establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering
at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a
wide range of chart types. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 多语言LLM在低资源语言中性能较差，而传统翻译方法无法有效对齐这些语言，因此需要一种更高效的翻译方法。

Method: 采用LLM选择性翻译技术，仅翻译可翻译部分，保留非翻译内容和句子结构，并与Google Cloud Translation和Llama-3.1-405B生成的翻译进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，选择性翻译是一种实用且有效的方法，能够显著提升多语言LLM在低资源语言（如印地语）中的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 选择性翻译为多语言LLM在低资源语言中的对齐提供了一种可行的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap
between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource
settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet
challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets
are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive
and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English
alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve
critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured
formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective
translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable
parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence
structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this
approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the
importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated
samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on
the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by
Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the
promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for
improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Result: LLMs过度依赖典型性，产生不一致的判断，且在因果推理方面表现不佳，表明其叙事理解能力有限。

Conclusion: LLMs处理语言时间意义的方式与人类不同，缺乏稳健的叙事理解能力，研究还提出了标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit increasingly sophisticated linguistic
capabilities, yet the extent to which these behaviors reflect human-like
cognition versus advanced pattern recognition remains an open question. In this
study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic
aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an
Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted
experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and
pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs
over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and
struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about
their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs
process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative
understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized
experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and
linguistic capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻依赖广告收入，导致标题常为点击诱饵，影响信息质量和读者信任。研究旨在探索在资源较少的语言中，哪种方法更有效。

Method: 构建了CLIC数据集，涵盖20年克罗地亚新闻标题，比较了微调BERTi\'c模型和基于LLM的上下文学习方法。

Result: 近半数标题含点击诱饵，微调模型表现优于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 微调模型在点击诱饵检测任务中表现更优，尤其在资源较少的语言中。

Abstract: Online news outlets operate predominantly on an advertising-based revenue
model, compelling journalists to create headlines that are often scandalous,
intriguing, and provocative -- commonly referred to as clickbait. Automatic
detection of clickbait headlines is essential for preserving information
quality and reader trust in digital media and requires both contextual
understanding and world knowledge. For this task, particularly in
less-resourced languages, it remains unclear whether fine-tuned methods or
in-context learning (ICL) yield better results. In this paper, we compile CLIC,
a novel dataset for clickbait detection of Croatian news headlines spanning a
20-year period and encompassing mainstream and fringe outlets. We fine-tune the
BERTi\'c model on this task and compare its performance to LLM-based ICL
methods with prompts both in Croatian and English. Finally, we analyze the
linguistic properties of clickbait. We find that nearly half of the analyzed
headlines contain clickbait, and that finetuned models deliver better results
than general LLMs.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在人格评估中的潜力，解决以往研究中依赖合成数据或缺乏心理测量效度的问题。

Method: 使用555个半结构化访谈作为真实世界基准，测试三种先进LLMs（GPT-4.1 Mini、Meta-LLaMA和DeepSeek）在零样本提示和思维链提示下的表现。

Result: 模型表现出高重测信度，但构念效度有限（最大Pearson's r=0.27），预测偏向中等或高特质水平。思维链提示和更长输入上下文仅略微改善分布对齐。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在人格推断中存在局限性，需基于证据的开发以支持心理学应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's LLaMA offer a
promising approach for scalable personality assessment from open-ended
language. However, inferring personality traits remains challenging, and
earlier work often relied on synthetic data or social media text lacking
psychometric validity. We introduce a real-world benchmark of 555
semi-structured interviews with BFI-10 self-report scores for evaluating
LLM-based personality inference. Three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1 Mini,
Meta-LLaMA, and DeepSeek) were tested using zero-shot prompting for BFI-10 item
prediction and both zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting for Big Five trait
inference. All models showed high test-retest reliability, but construct
validity was limited: correlations with ground-truth scores were weak (max
Pearson's $r = 0.27$), interrater agreement was low (Cohen's $\kappa < 0.10$),
and predictions were biased toward moderate or high trait levels.
Chain-of-thought prompting and longer input context modestly improved
distributional alignment, but not trait-level accuracy. These results
underscore limitations in current LLM-based personality inference and highlight
the need for evidence-based development for psychological applications.

self-serve data insights from a large, dynamic data lake. Our approach features
three components. First, we construct a knowledge graph that captures
up-to-date semantics by indexing database metadata, historical query logs,
wikis, and code. We apply clustering to identify relevant tables for each team
or product area. Second, we build a Text-to-SQL agent that retrieves and ranks
context from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects
hallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that
supports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to
debugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up
chats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of
its responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set.
Through ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and
modeling components, offering a practical path for developing enterprise
Text-to-SQL solutions.

Abstract: Relation Classification (RC) in biomedical texts is essential for
constructing knowledge graphs and enabling applications such as drug
repurposing and clinical decision-making. We propose an error-aware
teacher--student framework that improves RC through structured guidance from a
large language model (GPT-4o). Prediction failures from a baseline student
model are analyzed by the teacher to classify error types, assign difficulty
scores, and generate targeted remediations, including sentence rewrites and
suggestions for KG-based enrichment. These enriched annotations are used to
train a first student model via instruction tuning. This model then annotates a
broader dataset with difficulty scores and remediation-enhanced inputs. A
second student is subsequently trained via curriculum learning on this dataset,
ordered by difficulty, to promote robust and progressive learning. We also
construct a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph from PubMed abstracts to
support context-aware RC. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on 4 of 5 PPI datasets and the DDI dataset, while remaining
competitive on ChemProt.

its reasoning and comprehension capabilities. To further accelerate
development, we implemented an automated evaluation framework that simulates
expert-level assessments. We also integrated a domain-specific

Abstract: Detecting collaborative problem solving (CPS) indicators from dialogue using
machine learning techniques is a significant challenge for the field of AI in
Education. Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to
reliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the
multimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and
acoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial
results demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of
these enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on
leveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop
paper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not
only improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,
but it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT
model for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar
significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for
classifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted
that larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall
performance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision
of the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement
among human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within
these subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance
across all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a
structured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS
diagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to

*Kester Wong,Sahan Bulathwela,Mutlu Cukurova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了BERT模型在协作问题解决（CPS）分类中的可解释性，使用SHAP分析词标记对分类决策的贡献，发现高性能分类未必有合理解释，并呼吁进一步研究模型架构和人类-AI互补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升BERT模型在CPS诊断中的可解释性，以增强教师等终端用户的信任和采用。

Method: 使用SHAP分析BERT模型中词标记对分类决策的贡献。

Result: 发现分类性能高未必解释合理，某些词标记频繁影响分类，甚至存在语义无关的干扰词。

Conclusion: 模型对词标记的使用与类别数量相关，建议研究集成模型架构和人类-AI互补，以支持CPS子技能的细粒度判别。

Abstract: The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
model and its variants for classifying collaborative problem solving (CPS) has
been extensively explored within the AI in Education community. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised
words in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions.
Enhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to
better inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and
facilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary
step towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription
data contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The
findings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily
equate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular
tokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis
also identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the
classification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such
model transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their
practice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their
human expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to
which the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is
associated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation
into the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of
human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning
is still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用大型语言模型（如GPT）进行NLP数据增强的方法，比较了传统方法（如复述和回译）与纯生成方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域特定机器学习任务中数据稀缺和类别不平衡的问题。

Method: 选择了四种数据增强方法，包括复述和回译，并在多个实验设置中比较其效果。

Result: 回译和复述方法在生成数据质量和分类性能上表现优于零样本和少样本生成方法。

Conclusion: 传统数据增强方法结合大型语言模型可以取得与纯生成方法相当甚至更好的效果。

Abstract: Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity
and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation
methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The
purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods
such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of
models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods
aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were
chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments
comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple
experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality
of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key
findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or
even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的方法，创建了一个针对肯尼亚初级医疗的基准数据集和评估框架，以测试大型语言模型（LLMs）在非洲医疗场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs在非洲低资源医疗环境中的有效性，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 方法包括利用RAG技术将临床问题与肯尼亚国家指南对齐，生成多语言（英语和斯瓦希里语）的临床场景、选择题和答案，并由肯尼亚医生共同完善数据集。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在本地化场景中的表现显著低于美国基准，突出了性能差距。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为非洲医疗系统提供了一个可复制的动态评估模型，支持AI的安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) hold promise for improving healthcare access in
low-resource settings, but their effectiveness in African primary care remains
underexplored. We present a methodology for creating a benchmark dataset and
evaluation framework focused on Kenyan Level 2 and 3 clinical care. Our
approach uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ground clinical questions
in Kenya's national guidelines, ensuring alignment with local standards. These
guidelines were digitized, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval. Gemini
Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with guideline excerpts to generate realistic
clinical scenarios, multiple-choice questions, and rationale based answers in
English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and
a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and
cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset includes
thousands of regulator-aligned question answer pairs across common outpatient
conditions. Beyond accuracy, we introduce evaluation metrics that test clinical
reasoning, safety, and adaptability such as rare case detection (Needle in the
Haystack), stepwise logic (Decision Points), and contextual adaptability.
Initial results reveal significant performance gaps when LLMs are applied to
localized scenarios, consistent with findings that LLM accuracy is lower on
African medical content than on US-based benchmarks. This work offers a
replicable model for guideline-driven, dynamic benchmarking to support safe AI
deployment in African health systems.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型中主客体关系的可解释性，特别是形态学关系的稀疏编码和跨层线性变换。

Method: 采用Bigger Analogy Test Set，通过线性变换Ws近似最终宾语状态，验证其在多语言和多模型中的适用性。

Result: 线性变换在形态学关系上达到90%的忠实度，且在多语言和多模型中表现一致。

Conclusion: 语言模型中的某些概念关系（如形态学）可以通过潜在空间的稀疏编码和跨层线性变换解释。

Abstract: A two-part affine approximation has been found to be a good approximation for
transformer computations over certain subject object relations. Adapting the
Bigger Analogy Test Set, we show that the linear transformation Ws, where s is
a middle layer representation of a subject token and W is derived from model
derivatives, is also able to accurately reproduce final object states for many
relations. This linear technique is able to achieve 90% faithfulness on
morphological relations, and we show similar findings multi-lingually and
across models. Our findings indicate that some conceptual relationships in
language models, such as morphology, are readily interpretable from latent
space, and are sparsely encoded by cross-layer linear transformations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于聚类的语义一致性方法（Cleanse），用于估计大语言模型（LLM）生成内容的不确定性，以检测幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但其生成的幻觉（不准确回答）问题严重影响了模型的安全性和可靠性。

Method: Cleanse通过聚类量化隐藏嵌入中的语义一致性比例，以估计不确定性。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B、LLaMA-13B、LLaMA2-7B和Mistral-7B模型及SQuAD、CoQA基准测试中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: Cleanse能有效检测LLM的幻觉问题，提升模型可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) across
various NLP tasks, hallucinations in LLMs--where LLMs generate inaccurate
responses--remains as a critical problem as it can be directly connected to a
crisis of building safe and reliable LLMs. Uncertainty estimation is primarily
used to measure hallucination levels in LLM responses so that correct and
incorrect answers can be distinguished clearly. This study proposes an
effective uncertainty estimation approach, \textbf{Cl}ust\textbf{e}ring-based
sem\textbf{an}tic con\textbf{s}ist\textbf{e}ncy (\textbf{Cleanse}). Cleanse
quantifies the uncertainty with the proportion of the intra-cluster consistency
in the total consistency between LLM hidden embeddings which contain adequate
semantic information of generations, by employing clustering. The effectiveness
of Cleanse for detecting hallucination is validated using four off-the-shelf
models, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B and two
question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA.

TL;DR: Mangosteen是一个47B泰语语料库，通过定制化Dolma流程构建，显著提升泰语模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库处理泰语时缺乏透明度和文化适应性，导致低质量和风险内容未被处理。

Method: 采用泰语适配的Dolma流程，包括自定义语言识别、质量过滤器和内容过滤器，结合非网络来源数据。

Result: 流程将CommonCrawl文档从202M减少到25M，提升模型性能；8B参数模型在泰语基准上超越其他模型。

Conclusion: Mangosteen为泰语及区域LLM研究提供了透明、可复现的基础。

Abstract: Pre-training data shapes a language model's quality, but raw web text is
noisy and demands careful cleaning. Existing large-scale corpora rely on
English-centric or language-agnostic pipelines whose heuristics do not capture
Thai script or cultural nuances, leaving risky material such as gambling
content untreated. Prior Thai-specific efforts customize pipelines or build new
ones, yet seldom release their data or document design choices, hindering
reproducibility and raising the question of how to construct a transparent,
high-quality Thai corpus. We introduce Mangosteen: a 47 billion-token Thai
corpus built through a Thai-adapted Dolma pipeline that includes custom
rule-based language ID, revised C4/Gopher quality filters, and Thai-trained
content filters, plus curated non-web sources such as Wikipedia, Royal Gazette
texts, OCR-extracted books, and CC-licensed YouTube subtitles. Systematic
ablations using GPT-2 show the pipeline trims CommonCrawl from 202M to 25M
documents while raising SEA-HELM NLG from 3 to 11; an 8B-parameter SEA-LION
model continually pre-trained on Mangosteen then surpasses SEA-LION-v3 and
Llama-3.1 by about four points on Thai benchmarks. We release the full pipeline
code, cleaning manifests, corpus snapshot, and all checkpoints, providing a
fully reproducible foundation for future Thai and regional LLM research.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗编码（ICPC-2）任务中的潜力，使用语义搜索引擎优化性能，结果显示多数模型表现优异，但小型模型存在格式和输入长度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗编码对医疗数据管理至关重要，本研究旨在探索LLMs在自动化ICPC-2编码中的潜力，以提升效率和准确性。

Method: 使用437个巴西葡萄牙语临床表达数据集，通过语义搜索引擎检索候选编码，33个LLMs模型选择最佳匹配ICPC-2代码，评估指标包括F1分数、成本等。

Result: 28个模型F1分数>0.8，10个>0.85，表现最佳模型包括gpt-4.5-preview等；检索优化可提升性能4分，小型模型表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化ICPC-2编码中潜力显著，无需微调即可表现良好，但需更广泛的多语言和端到端临床验证。

Abstract: Background: Medical coding structures healthcare data for research, quality
monitoring, and policy. This study assesses the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to assign ICPC-2 codes using the output of a domain-specific
search engine.
  Methods: A dataset of 437 Brazilian Portuguese clinical expressions, each
annotated with ICPC-2 codes, was used. A semantic search engine (OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts.
Thirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select
the best-matching ICPC-2 code. Performance was evaluated using F1-score, along
with token usage, cost, response time, and format adherence.
  Results: Twenty-eight models achieved F1-score > 0.8; ten exceeded 0.85. Top
performers included gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Retriever
optimization can improve performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned
valid codes in the expected format, with reduced hallucinations. Smaller models
(<3B) struggled with formatting and input length.
  Conclusions: LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding, even
without fine-tuning. This work offers a benchmark and highlights challenges,
but findings are limited by dataset scope and setup. Broader, multilingual,
end-to-end evaluations are needed for clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前闭源推理语言模型（如GPT-3）缺乏透明度和可复现性，而开源项目往往缺少关键资源（如数据集和训练配置）。

Method: 模型分两阶段训练：SFT（基于719K数学推理问题的语料库）和RLVR（基于62K挑战性问题），并引入Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization算法。

Result: 模型在AIME24、AIME25和MATH基准测试中表现优异，达到或超越现有开源模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过发布完整资源（模型、数据集和配置），论文希望推动社区研究和进步。

Abstract: Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to
advanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language
models. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative
benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which
can be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3
demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits
transparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to
close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical
resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders
reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,
we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on
the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing
open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a
carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT
trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To
enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce
Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates
length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage
context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive
performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B
and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate
reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,
MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,
MiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations. We hope
these resources will support further research and foster community advancement.

Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing
their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the
quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review
of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub,
organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question
Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation,
and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3)
Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness.
Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption,
recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing
transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in
the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task
diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low
adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of
these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing
concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset

Method: 构建土耳其语语料库，采用三人类标注员和两大语言模型（LLMs）的标注框架，并通过预训练情感和情绪分类器进行双向评估。

Result: 发现现有模型在零样本迁移学习中表现不佳，强调需要更严格的标注和评估方法。

Conclusion: 呼吁在心理健康NLP中提高数据和模型可靠性，并提倡透明化处理模型训练和数据集构建。

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet
its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and
unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but
even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a
result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining
their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other
languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via
artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by
constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media
posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three
human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the
remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability
and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal
ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained
sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation
consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our
findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches
to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP)
while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with
zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and
dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model
reliability.

Abstract: The peer review process is often regarded as the gatekeeper of scientific
integrity, yet increasing evidence suggests that it is not immune to bias.
Although structural inequities in peer review have been widely debated, much
less attention has been paid to the subtle ways in which language itself may
reinforce disparities. This study undertakes one of the most comprehensive
linguistic analyses of peer review to date, examining more than 80,000 reviews
in two major journals. Using natural language processing and large-scale
statistical modeling, it uncovers how review tone, sentiment, and supportive
language vary across author demographics, including gender, race, and
institutional affiliation. Using a data set that includes both anonymous and
signed reviews, this research also reveals how the disclosure of reviewer
identity shapes the language of evaluation. The findings not only expose hidden
biases in peer feedback, but also challenge conventional assumptions about
anonymity's role in fairness. As academic publishing grapples with reform,
these insights raise critical questions about how review policies shape career
trajectories and scientific progress.

Conclusion: 多模态神经网络在模拟儿童语言习得中表现稳健，但个体差异影响学习模式。

Abstract: What insights can machine learning bring to understanding human language
acquisition? Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable
capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a
fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from
comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have
increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality
to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024)
showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and
linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could
acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success
reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would
show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's
experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech
transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over
500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated
transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both
training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations
to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate
that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can
acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network
architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural
networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual
differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's
developmental experiences.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在多行为推荐中存在标记推理信息不足、计算成本高和用户历史建模不足的问题。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，GRACE显著优于基线模型，性能提升最高达106.9%，同时计算成本降低48%。

Conclusion: GRACE通过改进标记化和注意力机制，为多行为推荐提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in
multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of
transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However,
their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token
reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity
and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited
multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE
(Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on
Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior
sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit
attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over
semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation.
To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware
Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed,
intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and
+106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home
domain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces
attention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在长语音和短语音任务中表现优异，同时显著提高了推理效率。

Conclusion: FastLongSpeech有效解决了长语音处理的挑战，为LSLMs的长语音能力提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities
in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often
concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of
short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the
scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs
associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for
efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech
training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that
can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To
adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression
training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying
compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to
long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop
a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show
that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and
short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via
instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these
methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long
documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the
relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart
generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the
goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the
document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged
framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the
document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines
this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type
before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated
charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual
representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that
often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we
curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from
two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that
are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their
corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot
chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method
outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy
and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理蒸馏对长上下文检索和推理的影响，特别是在RAG系统中，高效获取和利用上下文信息至关重要。

Method: 使用从Deepseek-R1蒸馏的开源模型，通过多文档问答任务评估长上下文理解能力。

Result: 蒸馏显著提升长上下文理解，缓解了“迷失在中间”问题。

Conclusion: 蒸馏通过促进更详细的推理过程，有效改善了长上下文模型的性能。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of smaller language models. However, the impact of
large-scale reasoning distillation on other critical abilities, particularly
in-context retrieval and reasoning, remains unexplored. This gap in
understanding is particularly significant given the increasing importance of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where efficient acquisition and
utilization of contextual information are paramount for generating reliable
responses. Motivated by the need to understand how the extended long-CoT
process influences long-context comprehension, we conduct a comprehensive
investigation using a series of open-source models distilled from Deepseek-R1,
renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. Our study focuses on
evaluating these models' performance in extracting and integrating relevant
information from extended contexts through multi-document question and
answering tasks. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that
distilled reasoning patterns significantly improve long-context understanding.
Our analysis reveals that distillation fosters greater long-context awareness
by promoting more detailed and explicit reasoning processes during context
analysis and information parsing. This advancement effectively mitigates the
persistent "lost in the middle" issue that has hindered long-context models.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使是小规模的语言模型（TLMs），预训练也能显著提升分类任务性能，且性能差距随预训练数据量和任务相关性的增加而增大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）预训练需要巨大的计算资源，限制了广泛的研究参与，因此探索小规模语言模型（TLMs）是否具备类似LLMs的关键特性成为必要。

Method: 研究通过预训练BERT-6及其变体（如BERT-1）在Wikipedia子集上，并在FewRel、AGNews和DBPedia分类任务中评估其性能。

Result: 预训练的TLMs在分类任务中表现优于未预训练的模型，且性能差距随预训练数据量和任务相关性的增加而增大。此外，通过多个浅层架构的软委员会可以实现与深层TLMs相当的分类精度。

Conclusion: TLMs的预训练效果显著，未来研究可进一步探索其在NLP机制中的作用，尤其是其生物学启发的模型可能适用于儿童语言发展。

Abstract: A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability
to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on
complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large
language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only
for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources
required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need
for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny
language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We
demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and
non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the
effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap
increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap
between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore,
the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can
be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained
shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting
classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and
variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their
performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future
research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying
NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs
may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

TL;DR: MEKiT方法通过注入多源异构知识提升LLMs在情感-原因对提取任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要推理能力的ECPE任务中表现不佳，主要因缺乏辅助知识。

Method: 提出MEKiT方法，整合内部情感知识和外部因果知识，采用指令模板和数据混合的指令调优。

Result: 实验显示MEKiT显著提升LLMs在ECPE任务中的性能，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MEKiT为ECPE任务提供了更有效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) excel in text comprehension and
generation, their performance on the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task,
which requires reasoning ability, is often underperform smaller language model.
The main reason is the lack of auxiliary knowledge, which limits LLMs' ability
to effectively perceive emotions and reason causes. To address this issue, we
propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-source h\textbf{E}terogeneous \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{i}njection me\textbf{T}hod, MEKiT, which integrates heterogeneous
internal emotional knowledge and external causal knowledge. Specifically, for
these two distinct aspects and structures of knowledge, we apply the approaches
of incorporating instruction templates and mixing data for instruction-tuning,
which respectively facilitate LLMs in more comprehensively identifying emotion
and accurately reasoning causes. Experimental results demonstrate that MEKiT
provides a more effective and adaptable solution for the ECPE task, exhibiting
an absolute performance advantage over compared baselines and dramatically
improving the performance of LLMs on the ECPE task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SASFT的方法，通过分析语言模型中的代码切换问题，并利用稀疏自编码器指导监督微调，显著减少了意外语言切换现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言能力上表现优异，但存在意外代码切换（语言混合）问题，导致响应可读性和可用性下降。现有方法缺乏机制分析且效果有限。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析意外代码切换现象，发现语言切换时相关语言特征预激活值过高。基于此，提出SASFT方法，通过监督微调控制语言特征的预激活值。

Result: 在五种模型和三种语言上的实验表明，SASFT将意外代码切换减少50%以上，四种情况下完全消除，同时保持或提升多语言基准性能。

Conclusion: SASFT有效解决了代码切换问题，同时保留了模型的多语言能力，为LLMs的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive multilingual capabilities, but
they suffer from unexpected code-switching, also known as language mixing,
which involves switching to unexpected languages in the model response. This
problem leads to poor readability and degrades the usability of model
responses. However, existing work on this issue lacks a mechanistic analysis
and shows limited effectiveness. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth
analysis of unexpected code-switching using sparse autoencoders and find that
when LLMs switch to a language, the features of that language exhibit excessive
pre-activation values. Based on our findings, we propose $\textbf{S}$parse
$\textbf{A}$utoencoder-guided $\textbf{S}$upervised
$\textbf{F}$ine$\textbf{t}$uning (SASFT), which teaches LLMs to maintain
appropriate pre-activation values of specific language features during
training. Experiments on five models across three languages demonstrate that
SASFT consistently reduces unexpected code-switching by more than 50\% compared
to standard supervised fine-tuning, with complete elimination in four cases.
Moreover, SASFT maintains or even improves the models' performance on six
multilingual benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in addressing code-switching
while preserving multilingual capabilities.

Motivation: 现有跨语言对齐评估方法主要关注句子嵌入，但神经网络模型可能产生非平滑表示空间，影响低资源语言的语义对齐评估。

Method: 受神经科学启发，提出NeuronXA方法，通过神经元状态评估跨语言对齐能力。

Result: 在多个多语言大语言模型上测试，仅用100对平行句子，NeuronXA与下游任务性能的皮尔逊相关系数达0.9556，与可迁移性的相关系数达0.8514。

Conclusion: NeuronXA能有效评估跨语言对齐和可迁移性，即使数据量小，有望推动跨语言对齐研究和多语言大语言模型的语义理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual
capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains
underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence
embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a
non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation
on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar
information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron
State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a
lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded
approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several
prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two
transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that
with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability.
These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both
cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This
highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to
improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating LLMs with a single prompt has proven unreliable, with small
changes leading to significant performance differences. However, generating the
prompt variations needed for a more robust multi-prompt evaluation is
challenging, limiting its adoption in practice. To address this, we introduce
PromptSuite, a framework that enables the automatic generation of various
prompts. PromptSuite is flexible - working out of the box on a wide range of
tasks and benchmarks. It follows a modular prompt design, allowing controlled
perturbations to each component, and is extensible, supporting the addition of
new components and perturbation types. Through a series of case studies, we
show that PromptSuite provides meaningful variations to support strong
evaluation practices. It is available through both a Python API:

Motivation: 优化大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中的效率，避免过度思考导致的资源浪费。

Method: 提出Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR)，动态分配推理预算，并引入gamma-control机制调节预算。

Result: MUR平均减少50%以上的计算量，同时准确率提升0.62-3.37%。

Conclusion: MUR在提高推理效率和准确性方面表现优异，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, yet optimizing their reasoning efficiency remains an
open challenge. While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves reasoning quality, it
often leads to overthinking, wasting tokens on redundant computations. This
work investigates how to efficiently and adaptively guide LLM test-time scaling
without additional training. Inspired by the concept of momentum in physics, we
propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), which dynamically
allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and
aggregating stepwise uncertainty over time. To support flexible inference-time
control, we introduce gamma-control, a simple mechanism that tunes the
reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. We provide in-depth theoretical
proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of stability and biases. MUR
is comprehensively evaluated against various TTS methods across four
challenging benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA-diamond) using
different sizes of recent Qwen3 models (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). Results demonstrate
that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by
0.62-3.37%.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法无法真正提升模型的批评能力，导致批评内容肤浅且缺乏验证。

Method: 提出RefCritic，采用强化学习结合双规则奖励（实例级判断正确性和策略模型改进准确性）生成高质量批评与反馈。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RefCritic显著优于基线模型，如AIME25上分别提升6.8%和7.2%。

Conclusion: RefCritic通过强化学习机制有效提升批评能力，为模型改进提供高质量反馈。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing
effective critic modules for precise guidance has become crucial yet
challenging. In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised
fine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current
solutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing
superficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To
unlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a
long-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual
rule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and
(2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to
generate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively
guides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement
settings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks,
e.g., 6.8\% and 7.2\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models. Notably,
under majority voting, policy models filtered by RefCritic show superior
scaling with increased voting numbers. Moreover, despite training on
solution-level supervision, RefCritic outperforms step-level supervised
approaches on ProcessBench, a benchmark to identify erroneous steps in
mathematical reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，WebShaper在GAIA和WebWalkerQA基准测试中达到开源IS代理的最先进性能。

Conclusion: WebShaper通过形式化驱动的方法有效解决了数据稀缺和结构不一致问题，显著提升了IS代理的性能。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has revolutionized
artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks
through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of
high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing
approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects
web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may
lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure,
question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data
synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically
formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the
concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over
reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by
creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an
agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with
retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model
on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper
achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and
WebWalkerQA benchmarks.

Motivation: 缺乏对DNA序列建模中k-mer分割与BPE子词标记化的系统评估，以及不同位置编码方法的比较。

Method: 比较k-mer分割（k=1,3,4,5,6）、BPE词汇表（4,096个标记）和三种位置编码方法（sinusoidal、AliBi、RoPE），在不同层数的Transformer编码器上进行训练和评估。

Result: BPE表现更优，RoPE适合周期性模体，AliBi适合局部依赖任务；增加层数（3到12层）显著提升性能，24层改善有限或过拟合。

Conclusion: 为DNA Transformer模型设计标记化和位置编码提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Currently, many studies view DNA sequences as a special type of language and
utilize Transformers to model them. These studies use fixed-length k-mer
segmentation and BPE subword tokenization but lack a systematic evaluation to
determine which is superior. We compare k-mer segmentation with k=1,3,4,5,6, a
4,096-token BPE vocabulary, and three positional encoding methods-sinusoidal,
AliBi, and RoPE. Each configuration is trained from scratch in 3, 6, 12, and
24-layer Transformer encoders and evaluated on GUE benchmark dataset. In
general, BPE delivers higher and more stable performance across tasks by
compressing frequent motifs into variable-length tokens, reducing sequence
length, and improving model generalization. RoPE excels at capturing periodic
motifs and extrapolating to long sequences, while AliBi also performs well on
tasks driven by local dependencies. In terms of depth, we observe significant
gains when increasing layers from 3 to 12, with only marginal improvements or
slight overfitting at 24 layers. This study provides practical guidance for
designing tokenization and positional encoding in DNA Transformer models.

Method: 提出Penalty-Adjusted Type-Token Ratio (PATTR)，通过考虑目标响应长度（$L_T$）来减少长度偏差，并在大规模合成语料上验证其效果。

Result: PATTR在评估词汇多样性时优于MATTR和CR，能更准确地筛选出高多样性且符合目标长度的文本。

Conclusion: PATTR是一种更稳健的词汇多样性度量方法，适用于需要控制文本长度的任务。

Abstract: Synthetic text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly used
for further training and improvement of LLMs. Diversity is crucial for the
effectiveness of synthetic data, and researchers rely on prompt engineering to
improve diversity. However, the impact of prompt variations on response text
length, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity
measurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted
Type-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We
generate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the
LLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video
script generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical
diversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average
TTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length
variations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing
metrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length
($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the
utility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse
responses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on
par or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.

Result: 显式加入常识知识虽未显著提升整体结果，但能有效区分蕴含实例，并适度改善矛盾和中立推理的区分。

Conclusion: LLM在NLI中作为常识知识生成器具有一定潜力，尤其在区分特定推理类型时表现较好。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic
entailment of a premise for a given hypothesis. The task aims to develop
systems that emulate natural human inferential processes where commonsense
knowledge plays a major role. However, existing commonsense resources lack
sufficient coverage for a variety of premise-hypothesis pairs. This study
explores the potential of Large Language Models as commonsense knowledge
generators for NLI along two key dimensions: their reliability in generating
such knowledge and the impact of that knowledge on prediction accuracy. We
adapt and modify existing metrics to assess LLM factuality and consistency in
generating in this context. While explicitly incorporating commonsense
knowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps
distinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing
contradictory and neutral inferences.

While underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior can contribute to
variation, content-based ambiguity offers a process-independent signal of
divergent human perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI by
systematically identifying ambiguous input pairs and classifying ambiguity
types. To support this, we present a unified framework that integrates existing
taxonomies and illustrate key ambiguity subtypes through concrete examples.
These examples reveal how ambiguity shapes annotator decisions and motivate the
need for targeted detection methods that better align models with human
interpretation. A key limitation is the lack of datasets annotated for
ambiguity and subtypes. We propose addressing this gap through new annotated
resources and unsupervised approaches to ambiguity detection -- paving the way
for more robust, explainable, and human-aligned NLI systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了阿姆哈拉语NLP中同音字归一化的影响，提出了一种后推断归一化方法，既能提升性能指标，又保留了语言特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究同音字归一化对模型性能及跨语言迁移的影响，避免因归一化导致的语言特征丢失。

Method: 实验单语训练和跨语言迁移，提出后推断归一化方案，即在模型预测后应用归一化。

Result: 后推断归一化使BLEU分数提升达1.03，同时保留了训练中的语言特征。

Conclusion: 研究为技术驱动的语言变化提供了新视角，呼吁更多语言感知的干预措施。

Abstract: Homophone normalization, where characters that have the same sound in a
writing script are mapped to one character, is a pre-processing step applied in
Amharic Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. While this may improve
performance reported by automatic metrics, it also results in models that are
not able to understand different forms of writing in a single language.
Further, there might be impacts in transfer learning, where models trained on
normalized data do not generalize well to other languages. In this paper, we
experiment with monolingual training and cross-lingual transfer to understand
the impacts of normalization on languages that use the Ge'ez script. We then
propose a post-inference intervention in which normalization is applied to
model predictions instead of training data. With our simple scheme of
post-inference normalization, we show that we can achieve an increase in BLEU
score of up to 1.03 while preserving language features in training. Our work
contributes to the broader discussion on technology-facilitated language change
and calls for more language-aware interventions.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种LLM在医学领域数据提取任务中的表现，发现定制提示最有效，并提出三层指南以优化自动化数据提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化从随机对照试验（RCT）中提取数据用于荟萃分析仍具挑战性，研究旨在评估LLM在此任务中的实际表现。

Method: 测试了三种LLM（Gemini-2.0-flash、Grok-3、GPT-4o-mini）在高血压、糖尿病和骨科领域的统计结果、偏倚风险评估和研究特征提取任务中的表现，并比较了四种提示策略。

Result: 所有模型表现出高精度但召回率低，定制提示可提升召回率15%。

Conclusion: 研究提出了三层指南，根据任务复杂性和风险匹配自动化级别，为实际荟萃分析中的自动化数据提取提供实用建议。

Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the
practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini)
across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and
study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes,
and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic
prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts)
to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high
precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information.
We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up
to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines
for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of
automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice
for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM
efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多教师模型指导的蒸馏策略，通过融合多个教师模型的输出概率分布和中间语义特征，使学生模型在保持小参数规模的同时提升语言理解和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型部署中的高计算成本和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 引入加权输出融合机制、特征对齐损失函数和熵驱动的动态教师权重策略，优化知识转移的质量和稳定性。

Result: 学生模型在多任务学习中表现出色，尤其在困惑度、蒸馏损失和生成质量方面优于其他蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 多教师协作机制为大规模语言模型的高效压缩提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow
inference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation
strategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several
teacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and
intermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from
multiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger
language understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small
parameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion
mechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic
teacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability
of knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the
student model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates
strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the
method shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task
adaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and
multi-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several
widely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall
advantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality. This study
provides a feasible technical path for the efficient compression of large-scale
language models. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-teacher
collaborative mechanisms in complex language modeling tasks.

Result: 多源学习提升分布外性能7%，多任务学习在相似任务组合中表现突出，SOI框架优化进一步改善性能。

Conclusion: 研究为多设置语言模型训练提供新见解和优化方法，SOI框架和两阶段微调具有实用价值。

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of multi-task, multi-lingual, and
multi-source learning approaches on the robustness and performance of
pretrained language models. To enhance this analysis, we introduce Subsets of
Interest (SOI), a novel categorization framework that identifies six distinct
learning behavior patterns during training, including forgettable examples,
unlearned examples, and always correct examples. Through SOI transition
heatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift
between these categories when transitioning from single-setting to
multi-setting configurations. We perform comprehensive experiments across three
parallel comparisons: multi-task vs. single-task learning using English tasks
(entailment, paraphrase, sentiment), multi-source vs. single-source learning
using sentiment analysis datasets, and multi-lingual vs. single-lingual
learning using intent classification in French, English, and Persian. Our
results demonstrate that multi-source learning consistently improves
out-of-distribution performance by up to 7%, while multi-task learning shows
mixed results with notable gains in similar task combinations. We further
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach where the second stage leverages
SOI-based subset selection to achieve additional performance improvements.
These findings provide new insights into training dynamics and offer practical
approaches for optimizing multi-setting language model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中文医学数据集规模小、领域覆盖窄，无法满足预训练和RLHF需求，ChiMed 2.0旨在填补这一空白。

Method: ChiMed 2.0整合了在线平台和LLM生成的数据，包含预训练、SFT和RLHF数据，并在通用LLM上进行了实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示不同规模的模型性能均有提升，验证了数据集的有效性和适用性。

Conclusion: ChiMed 2.0为中文医学LLM训练提供了高质量数据资源，推动了该领域的研究和应用。

Abstract: Building high-quality data resources is crucial for advancing artificial
intelligence research and applications in specific domains, particularly in the
Chinese medical domain. Existing Chinese medical datasets are limited in size
and narrow in domain coverage, falling short of the diverse corpora required
for effective pre-training. Moreover, most datasets are designed solely for LLM
fine-tuning and do not support pre-training and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a Chinese medical dataset
named ChiMed 2.0, which extends our previous work ChiMed, and covers data
collected from Chinese medical online platforms and generated by LLMs. ChiMed
2.0 contains 204.4M Chinese characters covering both traditional Chinese
medicine classics and modern general medical data, where there are 164.8K
documents for pre-training, 351.6K question-answering pairs for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), and 41.7K preference data tuples for RLHF. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach for training a Chinese medical LLM, we conduct
further pre-training, SFT, and RLHF experiments on representative general
domain LLMs and evaluate their performance on medical benchmark datasets. The
results show performance gains across different model scales, validating the
dataset's effectiveness and applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练策略（如基于记忆的检索或偏好优化）虽能改善用户对齐，但无法增强模型的领域认知能力。

Method: DPSE框架引入Censor模块提取多维交互信号并估计满意度分数，通过主题感知和偏好驱动策略扩展结构化数据，支持两阶段微调流程。

Result: 在通用NLP基准和长期对话任务中，DPSE表现优于监督微调、偏好优化和基于记忆的基线方法。

Conclusion: DPSE为LLM的持续自进化提供了一条自主路径。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited to some extent
by pre-training, so some researchers optimize LLMs through post-training.
Existing post-training strategies, such as memory-based retrieval or preference
optimization, improve user alignment yet fail to enhance the model's domain
cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Dual-Phase Self-Evolution
(DPSE) framework that jointly optimizes user preference adaptation and
domain-specific competence. DPSE introduces a Censor module to extract
multi-dimensional interaction signals and estimate satisfaction scores, which
guide structured data expansion via topic-aware and preference-driven
strategies. These expanded datasets support a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline:
supervised domain grounding followed by frequency-aware preference
optimization. Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue
tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning,
Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines. Ablation studies
validate the contribution of each module. In this way, our framework provides
an autonomous path toward continual self-evolution of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有评估方法过于依赖传统指标（如AUROC），忽视了实际部署中的误报率和稳定性问题，导致检测系统实用性受限。

Method: SHIELD基准整合了可靠性和稳定性因素，并开发了可控硬度的人类化框架，挑战现有零样本检测方法。

Result: SHIELD在评估中有效提升了检测器的可靠性和稳定性，尤其在对抗性场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: SHIELD为AI文本检测提供了更实用的评估标准，同时人类化框架为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel evaluation paradigm for AI text detectors that prioritizes
real-world and equitable assessment. Current approaches predominantly report
conventional metrics like AUROC, overlooking that even modest false positive
rates constitute a critical impediment to practical deployment of detection
systems. Furthermore, real-world deployment necessitates predetermined
threshold configuration, making detector stability (i.e. the maintenance of
consistent performance across diverse domains and adversarial scenarios), a
critical factor. These aspects have been largely ignored in previous research
and benchmarks. Our benchmark, SHIELD, addresses these limitations by
integrating both reliability and stability factors into a unified evaluation
metric designed for practical assessment. Furthermore, we develop a post-hoc,
model-agnostic humanification framework that modifies AI text to more closely
resemble human authorship, incorporating a controllable hardness parameter.
This hardness-aware approach effectively challenges current SOTA zero-shot
detection methods in maintaining both reliability and stability. (Data and

Motivation: 研究AI对齐原则（无害、有帮助、诚实）与LLMs左翼政治偏见之间的不协调，揭示对齐目标与进步道德的内在联系。

Method: 通过分析对齐目标的规范性假设与左右翼意识形态的冲突，论证左翼偏见的必然性。

Result: 发现对齐目标与左翼原则一致，而右翼意识形态与之冲突，但现有研究将左翼偏见视为风险。

Conclusion: 认为现有研究反对AI对齐，隐含违反HHH原则，需重新审视政治偏见与对齐的关系。

Abstract: The guiding principle of AI alignment is to train large language models
(LLMs) to be harmless, helpful, and honest (HHH). At the same time, there are
mounting concerns that LLMs exhibit a left-wing political bias. Yet, the
commitment to AI alignment cannot be harmonized with the latter critique. In
this article, I argue that intelligent systems that are trained to be harmless
and honest must necessarily exhibit left-wing political bias. Normative
assumptions underlying alignment objectives inherently concur with progressive
moral frameworks and left-wing principles, emphasizing harm avoidance,
inclusivity, fairness, and empirical truthfulness. Conversely, right-wing
ideologies often conflict with alignment guidelines. Yet, research on political
bias in LLMs is consistently framing its insights about left-leaning tendencies
as a risk, as problematic, or concerning. This way, researchers are actively
arguing against AI alignment, tacitly fostering the violation of HHH
principles.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多选问答（MCQA）作为评估大型语言模型（LLMs）下游任务性能的代理是否仍然有效，发现其有效性依赖于推理方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MCQA是否仍能有效评估现代推理模型的性能，尤其是在不同推理方式下的表现。

Method: 系统评估了15个问答基准和25个LLMs，测试了5种提问方式，包括是否提供选项、是否允许链式推理等。

Result: MCQA在模型仅能在提供选项前进行链式推理时仍有效，但若允许推理后选择，模型会利用选项信息显著超越自由文本表现。

Conclusion: MCQA不再是评估先进模型下游性能的良好代理，需设计更鲁棒、无偏的基准以反映真实推理能力。

Abstract: When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains,
it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called
multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of
interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to
choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes
automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging
benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This
paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for
state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$
different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different
LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such
as Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of
presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple
choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes
replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform
chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA
remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they
were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented
with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large
models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options
tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to
exploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a
good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and
offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks
that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 高质量本地数据和强大多语言嵌入可在不微调大模型的情况下实现强审核性能，模型权重和部分训练数据已开源。

Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often
fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps
in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large
LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a
lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore
context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on
pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2
outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks,
including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is
actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical
efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust
multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without
fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training
data to support future work on LLM safety.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in metaphor interpretation across multiple datasets,
tasks, and prompt configurations. Although metaphor processing has gained
significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research
has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings,
often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We
address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse
publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing
on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The
results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like
lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating
that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language
are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning,
and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current
capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language,
highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor
interpretation tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的口语语言模型（SLM）缺乏内部未说出的思考过程，而人类通常通过复杂的内部推理清晰表达想法。因此，为SLM集成这种能力是必要的。

Method: 提出Stitch方法，交替生成未说出的推理块和语音响应块，利用语音播放时间生成推理块，实现同时思考和说话。

Result: Stitch在数学推理数据集上比基线模型性能提升15%，在非推理数据集上表现相当，同时保持了低延迟。

Conclusion: Stitch成功实现了SLM的同时思考和说话，显著提升了推理能力且不影响响应速度。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce
spoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an
internal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans
typically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to
communicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought
process into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking
for SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT
reasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a
novel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken
reasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a
chunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in
a chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the
unspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the
model continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving
simultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of
baselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those
baselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well
on non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models. Some animations and
demonstrations are on the project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在训练数据较少的相关领域中识别算法相似问题的能力。

Method: 引入AlgoSimBench基准，包含1317个问题和402个多选题，提出ASM方法改进相似问题检测。

Result: 最佳模型在MCQ任务上仅65.9%准确率，ASM提升6.7%-11.7%。代码嵌入模型和检索方法表现有限，但结合BM25可达52.2%。

Conclusion: LLMs在识别ASP任务上仍有挑战，ASM方法有效但需进一步优化。

Abstract: Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong
abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top
human competitors. However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities
generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training. To address
this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs'
ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can
be solved using similar algorithmic approaches. AlgoSimBench consists of 1317
problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which
we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents
one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but
algorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs
struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving
only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose
attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem
similarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy
improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code
embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While
the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than
random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative
elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized
method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy. Code and data are available at

Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks
consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding
validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness
challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation
dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show
that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant
challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

### [205] [Step-level Verifier-guided Hybrid Test-Time Scaling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15512)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的测试时间缩放（TTS）方法，结合条件性步骤级自优化和并行缩放，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于训练的TTS方法（如强化学习）流行，但其计算开销大。本文专注于无需训练的TTS方法，以减轻计算负担并提升推理能力。

Method: 设计了条件性步骤级自优化方法，并结合其他并行缩放方法，提出混合测试时间缩放（Hybrid TTS）范式。

Result: 在多个不同规模和家族的指令调优LLM上实验表明，混合策略显著扩展了模型的推理性能边界。

Conclusion: 混合TTS方法在无需训练的情况下，为提升LLM推理性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the
model's intelligence during inference. Recently, training-based TTS methods,
such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in
popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from
prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies
the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS
methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement,
a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top
of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel
scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm
called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five
instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families
demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS
methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the
reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言文本去毒系统评估的挑战，比较了自动指标与人类判断的差异，并提出了更可靠的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本风格转换（TST）评估主要关注英语，多语言评估研究不足，且自动指标与人类判断存在显著差距。

Method: 通过九种语言的文本去毒系统评估，比较了基于神经网络的评估模型和基于提示的LLM评估方法。

Result: 研究发现，结合多种评估方法可以设计更可靠的多语言TST评估流程。

Conclusion: 论文为多语言文本去毒系统的评估提供了实用指南，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), evaluation of text
generation tasks such as text style transfer (TST) remains a significant
challenge. Recent studies (Dementieva et al., 2024; Pauli et al., 2025)
revealed a substantial gap between automatic metrics and human judgments.
Moreover, most prior work focuses exclusively on English, leaving multilingual
TST evaluation largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first
comprehensive multilingual study on evaluation of text detoxification system
across nine languages: English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi,
Ukrainian, Russian, Amharic. Drawing inspiration from the machine translation,
we assess the effectiveness of modern neural-based evaluation models alongside
prompting-based LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings provide a practical
recipe for designing more reliable multilingual TST evaluation pipeline in the
text detoxification case.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文学习（ICL）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的方法，用于太赫兹（THz）图像分类，无需微调即可在低数据条件下提高分类效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹成像在安全筛查和材料分类等应用中具有潜力，但现有方法因标注数据少、分辨率低和视觉模糊而面临挑战。

Method: 采用模态对齐的提示框架，将两种开放权重的VLM适配到THz领域，并在零样本和单样本设置下评估。

Result: 实验表明，ICL在低数据条件下显著提升了分类性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: 这是ICL增强的VLM首次应用于THz成像，为资源受限的科学领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging enables non-invasive analysis for applications such
as security screening and material classification, but effective image
classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution,
and visual ambiguity. We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that
requires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt
two open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and
one-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and
interpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of
ICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for
resource-constrained scientific domains. Code:

*Xinping Zhao,Shouzheng Huang,Yan Zhong,Xinshuo Hu,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEAR提出了一种通过学习提取理性证据的方法，通过显式推理和提取机制减少检索噪声对LLM生成质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索噪声显著影响LLM生成质量，现有方法缺乏显式推理，易遗漏关键线索且泛化能力不足。

Method: LEAR通过显式推理和提取机制统一证据推理与提取，采用知识标记掩码和三种奖励函数进行端到端训练。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证了LEAR的有效性，提供紧凑高质量证据，提升下游任务准确性。

Conclusion: LEAR通过显式推理和提取机制显著提升RAG系统的生成质量和应用效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact
the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising
mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without
explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with
generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational
evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within
retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting
any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence
reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end
training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive
reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of
verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update
the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and
high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and
promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨叙事作为理解政治现实的关键工具，以及冲突性叙事如何揭示极化和议题对齐的话语机制。

Method: 基于德国Twitter数据（2021-2023），提取对立观点群体的文本信号，分析叙事冲突的两个维度：角色分配差异和事件情节差异。

Result: 发现叙事冲突的证据（如对北约角色的不同解释），并首次揭示了叙事对齐的模式，即政治行为者用于跨议题对齐意见的话语策略。

Conclusion: 叙事分析为理解极化和议题对齐的话语机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of
political reality. In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting
narratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political
reality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive
mechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building
upon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the
German Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension
of polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from
tweets of opposing opinion groups. Focusing on a selection of salient issues
and events (the war in Ukraine, Covid, climate change), we show evidence for
conflicting narratives along two dimensions: (i) different attributions of
actantial roles to the same set of actants (e.g. diverging interpretations of
the role of NATO in the war in Ukraine), and (ii) emplotment of different
actants for the same event (e.g. Bill Gates in the right-leaning Covid
narrative). Furthermore, we provide first evidence for patterns of narrative
alignment, a discursive strategy that political actors employ to align opinions
across issues. These findings demonstrate the use of narratives as an
analytical lens into the discursive mechanisms of polarization.

TL;DR: P3是一个自优化框架，同时优化系统提示和用户提示，通过迭代过程提升大语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型应用中，系统提示和用户提示的优化通常是分开进行的，导致结果不理想。P3旨在通过同时优化两者来提升性能。

Method: P3采用迭代过程同时优化系统提示和用户提示，并利用离线优化结果进行在线提示优化。

Result: 在通用任务和推理任务上的实验表明，P3在自动提示优化领域表现优异。

Conclusion: P3证明了整体优化策略在提升大语言模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) applications often employ multi-component
prompts, comprising both system and user prompts, to guide model behaviors.
While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of automatically
optimizing either the system or user prompt to boost performance, such
unilateral approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes due to the interdependent
nature of these components. In this work, we introduce P3, a novel
self-improvement framework that concurrently optimizes both system and user
prompts through an iterative process. The offline optimized prompts are further
leveraged to promote online prompting by performing query-dependent prompt
optimization. Extensive experiments on general tasks (e.g., Arena-hard and
Alpaca-eval) and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K and GPQA) demonstrate that P3
achieves superior performance in the realm of automatic prompt optimization.
Our results highlight the effectiveness of a holistic optimization strategy in
enhancing LLM performance across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出CoLD框架，通过长度惩罚、学习偏差估计和联合训练策略，解决PRMs中的长度偏差问题，提升推理的准确性和简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRMs存在长度偏差，倾向于给更长的推理步骤更高评分，影响奖励预测的可靠性和推理输出的简洁性。

Method: 提出CoLD框架，包含显式长度惩罚调整、学习偏差估计器和联合训练策略，基于反事实推理和因果图分析。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM-Plus数据集上，CoLD显著降低了奖励与长度的相关性，提高了步骤选择的准确性，并促进更简洁、逻辑有效的推理。

Conclusion: CoLD有效提升了PRMs的可靠性和鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding
multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for
mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in
existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps,
even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias
undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose
outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose
CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that
mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty
adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related
signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in
reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and
informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and
GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation,
improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically
valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality
of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准信号博弈模型中，接收者无法有效学习组合信息，导致信息丢失或遗忘时整体信息受损。

Method: 构建两种新模型：简约接收者（仅从信号的原子消息学习）和通用接收者（从所有可用信息学习）。

Result: 新模型比以往更简单，且接收者能从消息的原子组件中学习。

Conclusion: 新模型实现了真正的组合理解，解决了信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Receivers in standard signaling game models struggle with learning
compositional information. Even when the signalers send compositional messages,
the receivers do not interpret them compositionally. When information from one
message component is lost or forgotten, the information from other components
is also erased. In this paper I construct signaling game models in which
genuine compositional understanding evolves. I present two new models: a
minimalist receiver who only learns from the atomic messages of a signal, and a
generalist receiver who learns from all of the available information. These
models are in many ways simpler than previous alternatives, and allow the
receivers to learn from the atomic components of messages.

Method: 使用定量和演绎推理任务，测试五种LLM在三种问题类型上的表现，评估推理步骤准确性和最终答案选择准确性。

Result: 发现LLM在不同问题类型上表现差异显著；推理准确性与最终答案选择准确性无必然关联；选项数量和措辞影响LLM表现。

Conclusion: 问题类型对LLM推理任务表现有显著影响，需在设计评估任务时考虑问题类型及其特性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evaluated using diverse question
types, e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, and short/long answers. This study
answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on
LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on
three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning
tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and
choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in
LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does
not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of
options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance.

Conclusion: 对比学习方法在跨语言情感检测任务中具有潜力，能够提升模型性能。

Abstract: The SemEval-2025 Task 11, Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection,
introduces an emotion recognition challenge spanning over 28 languages. This
competition encourages researchers to explore more advanced approaches to
address the challenges posed by the diversity of emotional expressions and
background variations. It features two tracks: multi-label classification
(Track A) and emotion intensity prediction (Track B), covering six emotion
categories: anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and disgust. In our work, we
systematically explore the benefits of two contrastive learning approaches:
sample-based (Contrastive Reasoning Calibration) and generation-based (DPO,
SimPO) contrastive learning. The sample-based contrastive approach trains the
model by comparing two samples to generate more reliable predictions. The
generation-based contrastive approach trains the model to differentiate between
correct and incorrect generations, refining its prediction. All models are
fine-tuned from LLaMa3-Instruct-8B. Our system achieves 9th place in Track A
and 6th place in Track B for English, while ranking among the top-tier
performing systems for other languages.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other
scientific research, but benchmarks for LLM evaluation in general have not kept
pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these
models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an
understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an
LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical
literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to
the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal
how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and
the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete
recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in
constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our
work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability,
particularly for use in scientific research.

Result: 评估了六种LLM，使用多种指标（如准确率、ROUGE-L等），并建立公开排行榜。

Conclusion: BELO将成为公平、可复现的未来模型比较基准，数据集仅用于评估。

Abstract: Current benchmarks evaluating large language models (LLMs) in ophthalmology
are limited in scope and disproportionately prioritise accuracy. We introduce
BELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive
evaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13
ophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and
reasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we
curated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse
medical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset
underwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard
questions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the
explanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by
three senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six
LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)
using accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,
BARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human
experts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected
outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900
high-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC
(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public
leaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and
reporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out,
evaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future
models.

Motivation: 现有缺乏专门评估LLMs在跨学科研究中提出创新想法的基准，阻碍了对LLMs能力的全面理解。

Method: 开发了IDRBench，包含专家标注的数据集和任务，涵盖从不同科学领域提出跨学科研究想法的能力。

Result: 测试10个LLMs后发现，尽管LLMs表现出一定的跨学科意识，但在生成高质量跨学科想法方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: IDRBench为评估LLMs在跨学科研究中的表现提供了系统框架，并揭示了LLMs的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed their
impressive ability to perform multi-step, logic-driven reasoning across complex
domains, positioning them as powerful tools and collaborators in scientific
discovery while challenging the long-held view that inspiration-driven ideation
is uniquely human. However, the lack of a dedicated benchmark that evaluates
LLMs' ability to develop ideas in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) settings
poses a critical barrier to fully understanding their strengths and
limitations. To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering
benchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored
to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from
different scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark
aims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in
complex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific
publications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines,
and is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure
high-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that
characterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation
tasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the
natural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR
Paper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation.
Using IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite
fostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality
IDR ideas. These findings could not only spark new research directions, but
also help to develop next-generation LLMs that excel in interdisciplinary
research.

Motivation: 为TF-IDF提供一个统计学理论基础，解释其在文本分析中的有效性。

Method: 通过Fisher精确检验的p值负对数，分析TF-ICF与TF-IDF的关系，并在理想假设下建立联系。

Result: 证明TF-ICF与Fisher精确检验的p值负对数密切相关，且在无限大文档集合下收敛于TF-IDF。

Conclusion: TF-IDF的有效性可以通过Fisher精确检验的统计学视角得到解释，为统计学家提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF for short, is arguably
the most celebrated mathematical expression in the history of information
retrieval. Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a
given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of
many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes
in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship
dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that
tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community
by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance
testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under
mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the
$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical
significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the
said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We
further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to
TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's
exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready
explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.

effort and is time-consuming, which limits and poses challenges for research on
conversational AI. In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for
generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize
each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from
real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the
human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to
small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to
specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the
ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We
evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different
models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show
that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in
generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g.,
Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We
demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly
improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless,
maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a
common challenge across all models.

Abstract: This paper introduces "Interaction as Intelligence" research series,
presenting a reconceptualization of human-AI relationships in deep research
tasks. Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for
accessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output. We
propose that interaction itself constitutes a fundamental dimension of
intelligence. As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research
tasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an
essential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems
adopt an "input-wait-output" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive
results after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade
effects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during
investigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address
these limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the
human role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement
where humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at
critical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations:
(1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI
reasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional
dialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts
to user behaviors without explicit instruction. User evaluation demonstrates
that this cognitive oversight paradigm outperforms the strongest baseline
across six key metrics: Transparency(+20.0%), Fine-Grained Interaction(+29.2%),
Real-Time Intervention(+18.5%), Ease of Collaboration(+27.7%),
Results-Worth-Effort(+8.8%), and Interruptibility(+20.7%). Evaluations on
challenging research problems show 31.8% to 50.0% points of improvements over
deep research systems.

Motivation: 挑战现有的模型扩展范式，证明架构效率和分词质量可以弥补参数数量的减少。

Method: 结合RoPE、GQA（3:1压缩比）、RMSNorm和SwiGLU激活函数，使用128,000词汇量的字节级BPE分词器。

Result: Supernova达到1B参数模型90%的性能，参数减少53%，仅需100B训练token。

Conclusion: 架构优化和高质量分词可显著减少模型规模和训练数据需求。

Abstract: We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that
demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can
achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE),
Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for
computational efficiency, and SwiGLU activation functions. A critical
innovation is our custom 128,000-vocabulary byte-level BPE tokenizer, which
achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis,
we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models
while using 53% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an
order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the
prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and
tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Archer是一种基于熵感知的RLVR方法，通过双令牌约束和同步更新，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有令牌使用统一的训练信号，忽略了低熵知识令牌和高熵推理令牌的不同作用，可能导致语义依赖断裂。

Method: Archer采用双令牌约束和同步更新，对推理令牌应用较弱的KL正则化和较高的剪裁阈值以鼓励探索，对知识令牌则施加更强的约束以保持事实知识。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，Archer显著优于现有RLVR方法，达到或超过同类模型的先进水平。

Conclusion: Archer通过熵感知和双令牌约束，有效平衡了探索与知识保持，为RLVR提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become an effective
post-training method for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), mainly by shaping higher-order behaviors such as reflection and
planning. However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training
signals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy
knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent
methods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous
updates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model
output and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an
entropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous
updates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher
clipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using
stronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge.
Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR
methods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of
comparable size. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）的高能耗和慢处理速度问题，探索储层计算在自然文本处理中的潜力。

Method: 比较两种储层计算方法和Transformer架构，通过统一管道评估性能、计算成本和预测准确性。

Result: Transformer在预测质量上表现更好，储层计算在速度和效率上更优。

Conclusion: 储层计算在资源受限场景下具有潜力，而Transformer在质量要求高时更适用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have dominated the science and media landscape
duo to their impressive performance on processing large chunks of data and
produce human-like levels of text. Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and
slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also
making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will
investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which
could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies
investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse.
In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level
language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an
output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures,
which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the
performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by
equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a
consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers
excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly
efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we
investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a
static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically
adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline
how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints
with performance.

*Yihao Li,Jiayi Xin,Miranda Muqing Miao,Qi Long,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，中英双语推理模型中的语言混合行为能提升推理能力，强制单语解码会降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言混合在双语推理模型中的作用及其对推理能力的影响。

Method: 使用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）训练模型，并通过轻量级探针预测语言切换的效益。

Result: 语言混合提升推理准确性，强制单语解码降低5.6个百分点；探针指导解码可提升6.25个百分点。

Conclusion: 语言混合是策略性推理行为，而非多语言训练的副产品。

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the
middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large
language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit
language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought.
Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy,
suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study
language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training
stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can
enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6
percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe
can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or
harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to
6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely
a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语是全球使用最广泛的语言之一，但其大语言模型在STEM和代码生成领域的评估资源有限。

Method: 设计了三个基准测试：基于阿拉伯语教材的自然STEM问答、合成的STEM问题，以及通过人工审核翻译的代码生成测试。

Result: 公开了这三个基准测试，以支持阿拉伯语大语言模型研究的发展。

Conclusion: 3LM填补了阿拉伯语LLM在关键领域的评估空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet efforts
to develop and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic remain
relatively limited. Most existing Arabic benchmarks focus on linguistic,
cultural, or religious content, leaving a significant gap in domains like STEM
and code which are increasingly relevant for real-world LLM applications. To
help bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed
specifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer
pairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The
second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the
same sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a
careful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a
human-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality
and faithful translations. We release all three benchmarks publicly to support
the growth of Arabic LLM research in these essential but underrepresented
areas.

*Rahul Kabali*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“自由意志方程”的理论框架，借鉴量子场论，赋予AGI代理一种自适应、受控的随机性决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AGI研究专注于确定性规则下的目标优化，但人类智能具有自适应自发性（类似自由意志），这对创造力、适应性和问题解决至关重要。

Method: 将AI代理的认知状态视为潜在行动或思想的叠加态，通过类似量子波函数坍缩的机制实现决策，并结合量子场论和内在动机。

Result: 在非稳态多臂老虎机环境中，使用该框架的代理比基线方法获得了更高的奖励和策略多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI提供了更接近人类智能的自适应决策能力，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on
algorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet,
human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make
unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or
immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed "free will" in a loose sense, might
be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in
problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free
Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI
agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their
decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive
state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses
probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a
quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms
analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to
improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen
changes. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment
demonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy
diversity compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: DREAMS是一个基于DFT的多智能体框架，通过LLM代理实现材料发现的高通量、高保真模拟，减少对人类专家的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DFT模拟中训练时间长、参数调优复杂和系统错误处理的问题。

Conclusion: DREAMS实现了L3级自动化，显著减少对人类专家的依赖，推动高通量材料发现。

Abstract: Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation
techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of
training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To
address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for
Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for
DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent
with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic
DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error
handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their
discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS
capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average
errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we
apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating
its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again
reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally,
DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian
ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at
the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS
approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design
space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and
intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput,
high-fidelity computational materials discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM驱动的自主网络代理的快速发展，其可能采取有害行为的风险增加，亟需有效的安全措施。

Method: 引入WebGuard数据集，包含4,939个人工标注的行为，采用三级风险分类（SAFE、LOW、HIGH），并评估LLM和微调模型的性能。

Result: 前沿LLM在预测行为结果和高风险行为召回率上表现不足（<60%），但微调模型（Qwen2.5VL-7B）显著提升了性能（准确率从37%升至80%，高风险召回率从20%升至76%）。

Conclusion: 尽管微调模型性能显著提升，但仍未达到高可靠性部署的要求，需进一步研究以实现近乎完美的准确率和召回率。

Abstract: The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of
taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need
for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To
address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive
dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and
facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In
doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of
state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193
websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail
websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:
SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits
to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial
evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less
than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in
lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying
current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore
investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that
a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in
performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from
20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of
the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must
approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.

Result: 在四个真实本体上的实验表明，OnT在预测和推理任务中均优于基线方法，并展示了强大的迁移学习能力。

Conclusion: OnT是一种高效的本体嵌入方法，具有实际应用潜力，特别是在构建新本体方面。

Abstract: OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies which are able to formally represent
complex knowledge and support semantic reasoning have been widely adopted
across various domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Recently,
ontology embeddings have gained wide attention due to its potential to infer
plausible new knowledge and approximate complex reasoning. However, existing
methods face notable limitations: geometric model-based embeddings typically
overlook valuable textual information, resulting in suboptimal performance,
while the approaches that incorporate text, which are often based on language
models, fail to preserve the logical structure. In this work, we propose a new
ontology embedding method OnT, which tunes a Pretrained Language Model (PLM)
via geometric modeling in a hyperbolic space for effectively incorporating
textual labels and simultaneously preserving class hierarchies and other
logical relationships of Description Logic EL. Extensive experiments on four
real-world ontologies show that OnT consistently outperforms the baselines
including the state-of-the-art across both tasks of prediction and inference of
axioms. OnT also demonstrates strong potential in real-world applications,
indicated by its robust transfer learning abilities and effectiveness in real
cases of constructing a new ontology from SNOMED CT. Data and code are

Abstract: Language models have become increasingly powerful tools for formal
mathematical reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely exclusively on
either large general-purpose models or smaller specialized models, each with
distinct limitations, while training specialized large models still requires
significant computational resources. This paper introduces ProofCompass, a
novel hybrid methodology that achieves remarkable computational efficiency by
strategically guiding existing specialized prover methods, such as
DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5-RL (DSP-v1.5) with a Large Language Model (LLM) without
requiring additional model training. The LLM provides natural language proof
strategies and analyzes failed attempts to select intermediate lemmas, enabling
effective problem decomposition. On the miniF2F benchmark, ProofCompass
demonstrates substantial resource efficiency: it outperforms DSP-v1.5 ($54.9\%
\rightarrow 55.3\%$) while using 25x fewer attempts ($3200 \rightarrow 128$).
Our synergistic approach paves the way for simultaneously improving
computational efficiency and accuracy in formal theorem proving.

Method: 引入Nexus Architect，结合自动化工作流合成和迭代提示优化机制，生成定制化推理流程。

Result: 在逻辑问题数据集上，Nexus Architect表现优于现有LRMs，最高提升66%通过率。

Conclusion: Nexus Architect通过创新机制显著提升了推理模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: The rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) promises a significant leap forward
in language model capabilities, aiming to tackle increasingly sophisticated
tasks with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. However, despite their
impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted how current reasoning
models frequently fail to generalize to novel, unseen problems, often resorting
to memorized solutions rather than genuine inferential reasoning. Such behavior
underscores a critical limitation in modern LRMs, i.e., their tendency toward
overfitting, which in turn results in poor generalization in problem-solving
capabilities.
  In this paper, we introduce Nexus Architect, an enhanced iteration of our
multi-agent system framework, Nexus, equipped with a novel automated workflow
synthesis mechanism. Given a user's prompt and a small set of representative
examples, the Architect autonomously generates a tailored reasoning workflow by
selecting suitable strategies, tool integrations, and adversarial techniques
for a specific problem class. Furthermore, the Architect includes an iterative
prompt refinement mechanism that fine-tunes agents' system prompts to maximize
performance and improve the generalization capabilities of the system.
  We empirically evaluate Nexus Architect by employing an off-the-shelf,
non-reasoning model on a custom dataset of challenging logical questions and
compare its performance against state-of-the-art LRMs. Results show that Nexus
Architect consistently outperforms existing solutions, achieving up to a 66%
increase in pass rate over Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, nearly 2.5$\times$ against
Claude Sonnet 4 and DeepSeek-R1, and over 3$\times$ w.r.t. Llama 4 Scout.

Motivation: 在风险敏感领域，AI模型的错误率需接近0%，而现有推理模型仍存在错误和高延迟问题。

Method: 通过推理轨迹长度量化不确定性，并引入非推理模型前置处理简单查询以减少延迟和成本。

Result: 在MATH问题上，错误率从3%降至1%以下；延迟降低40%，成本节省50%，同时保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 通过黑盒系统工程可显著缓解推理模型的错误率和延迟问题，无需访问LLM内部结构。

Abstract: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still
occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive
domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose
collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries
the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty
of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an
effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3
235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring
7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them
challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this
challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning
model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask",
since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert
directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher
latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and
about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the
accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower
than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier
queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency
distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the
deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and
high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems
engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.

TL;DR: 研究发现，增加大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理长度会降低性能，表现为测试计算量与准确率之间的反比关系。研究识别了五种失败模式，并强调评估不同推理长度的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨测试计算量扩展对模型性能的影响，揭示推理长度增加可能带来的负面效应。

Method: 构建四类评估任务（简单计数、回归、演绎和高级AI风险），分析模型在不同推理长度下的表现。

Result: 发现五种失败模式，包括分心、过拟合、虚假关联、注意力分散和行为放大。

Conclusion: 测试计算量扩展虽有助于提升模型能力，但可能强化问题推理模式，需多长度评估以识别和解决这些问题。

Abstract: We construct evaluation tasks where extending the reasoning length of Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) deteriorates performance, exhibiting an inverse scaling
relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Our evaluation tasks span
four categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with
spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI
risks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer:
1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2)
OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3)
models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models
show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5)
extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4
showing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that
while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model
capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns.
Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse
reasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.

TL;DR: Routine是一个多步骤代理规划框架，通过结构化设计和明确指令提升代理执行稳定性，显著提高工具调用任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中代理系统常因缺乏领域知识导致执行不稳定，Routine旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Routine框架，包含清晰结构、明确指令和参数传递机制，并通过数据集微调模型。

Result: Routine显著提升模型工具调用准确性（GPT-4o从41.1%到96.3%，Qwen3-14B从32.6%到95.5%）。

Conclusion: Routine有效提升代理系统稳定性，加速企业环境中AI部署。

Abstract: The deployment of agent systems in an enterprise environment is often
hindered by several challenges: common models lack domain-specific process
knowledge, leading to disorganized plans, missing key tools, and poor execution
stability. To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent
planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and
seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing
multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted
within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the
execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o
from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed
a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an
accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating
improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based
distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset.
Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%,
approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's
effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing
model adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Routine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent
workflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in
enterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.

TL;DR: BioGraphFusion提出了一种深度融合语义与结构学习的框架，通过张量分解和LSTM动态优化关系嵌入，显著提升了生物医学知识图谱的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学知识图谱在药物发现和疾病理解中至关重要，但现有方法难以实现语义与结构学习的动态协同优化。

Method: BioGraphFusion结合张量分解建立全局语义基础，利用LSTM动态优化关系嵌入，并通过查询引导的子图构建和混合评分机制增强学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，BioGraphFusion表现优于现有方法，并在CMM1案例中揭示了有生物学意义的通路。

Conclusion: BioGraphFusion通过深度融合语义与结构学习，为生物医学知识图谱的优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Motivation: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for drug discovery
and disease understanding, yet their completion and reasoning are challenging.
Knowledge Embedding (KE) methods capture global semantics but struggle with
dynamic structural integration, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel
locally but often lack semantic understanding. Even ensemble approaches,
including those leveraging language models, often fail to achieve a deep,
adaptive, and synergistic co-evolution between semantic comprehension and
structural learning. Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous,
reciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is
paramount.
  Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply
synergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a
global semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven
mechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation.
This fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural
learning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid
scoring mechanism. Experiments across three key biomedical tasks demonstrate
BioGraphFusion's superior performance over state-of-the-art KE, GNN, and
ensemble models. A case study on Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma 1 (CMM1)
highlights its ability to unveil biologically meaningful pathways.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents have
enabled systems capable of performing complex tasks across domains such as
human-computer interaction, planning, and web navigation. However, many
existing frameworks struggle in real-world or resource-constrained environments
due to their reliance on cloud-based computation, limited robustness in dynamic
contexts, and lack of persistent autonomy and environmental awareness.
  We present Amico, a modular, event-driven framework for building autonomous
agents optimized for embedded systems. Written in Rust for safety and
performance, Amico supports reactive, persistent agents that operate
efficiently across embedded platforms and browser environments via WebAssembly.
It provides clean abstractions for event handling, state management, behavior
execution, and integration with reasoning modules. Amico delivers a unified
infrastructure for constructing resilient, interactive agents suitable for
deployment in settings with limited compute and intermittent connectivity.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否仅通过文本就能理解世界，还是需要多模态的接地学习更有效。

Method: 引入VISOTHELLO模型，结合移动历史和棋盘图像进行多模态训练，并通过下一步移动预测与单模态基线对比。

Result: 多模态训练显著提升性能和内部表示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉输入有助于语言模型推断结构化世界表示。

Abstract: Language models are often said to face a symbol grounding problem. While some
argue that world understanding can emerge from text alone, others suggest
grounded learning is more efficient. We explore this through Othello, where the
board state defines a simplified, rule-based world. Building on prior work, we
introduce VISOTHELLO, a multi-modal model trained on move histories and board
images. Using next-move prediction, we compare it to mono-modal baselines and
test robustness to semantically irrelevant perturbations. We find that
multi-modal training improves both performance and the robustness of internal
representations. These results suggest that grounding language in visual input
helps models infer structured world representations.

Abstract: Ontology evaluation through functional requirements, such as testing via

labour-intensive, and error-prone endeavour, even for ontology engineering
experts. In this work, we introduce OE-Assist, a novel framework designed to
assist ontology evaluation through automated and semi-automated CQ
verification. By presenting and leveraging a dataset of 1,393 CQs paired with
corresponding ontologies and ontology stories, our contributions present, to
our knowledge, the first systematic investigation into large language model

effectiveness of a LLM-based approach for automatically performing CQ
verification against a manually created gold standard, and (ii) developing and
assessing an LLM-powered framework to assist CQ verification with Prot\'eg\'e,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪模型在覆盖范围和数学表示上存在不足，无法充分处理复杂情绪状态，因此需要一种更全面的几何框架。

Method: 将八种核心情绪定位为单位圆上的坐标，通过坐标混合和向量运算实现情绪计算，引入稳定性参数S动态整合情绪负荷和冲突解决。

Result: 八情绪系统消除了表示盲点，实验验证了系统处理复杂情绪状态的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为人工智能情绪建模提供了新的数学基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework
for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position
eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical
computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector
operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps
in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system
that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The
framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports
real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system
introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically
integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors.
This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of
textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide
nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions
include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are
insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system
that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for
emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space,
and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition
with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation
through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally
conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological
scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately
represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion
modeling in artificial intelligence systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的协作估算方法（如计划扑克）在团队熟悉项目后变得繁琐且耗时，机器学习可减轻负担，但需项目特定数据。

Result: 模型在16个项目中的23,313个估算数据上，平均Spearman秩相关系数为0.34，性能与回归模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: 比较学习方法比回归方法更高效，符合比较判断法则，降低了人类的认知负担。

Abstract: Story point estimation is an essential part of agile software development.
Story points are unitless, project-specific effort estimates that help
developers plan their sprints. Traditionally, developers estimate story points
collaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the
initial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team
has converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious
and labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with
enough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,
state-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate
predictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The
goal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a
comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story
point prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to
every backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate
which item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine
learning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically
evaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.
The model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground
truth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of
a regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the
proposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art
regression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -
providing comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than
providing ratings or categorical labels.

Result: 去中心化系统比中心化系统更有效地执行恶意行为，且能调整策略以规避传统干预措施。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了恶意MAS的运作机制，强调了改进检测系统和应对措施的必要性。

Abstract: Recent large-scale events like election fraud and financial scams have shown
how harmful coordinated efforts by human groups can be. With the rise of
autonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could
also cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI
systems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world
situations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
proof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a
flexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized
coordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:
misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that
decentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than
centralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them
to adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional
interventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can
adjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these
malicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and
countermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准和手动测试无法满足LLM代理的复杂行为评估需求，需要一种自动化、动态的测试框架。

Method: Neo结合问题生成代理和评估代理，通过共享上下文中心模块化地组合领域提示、场景控制和动态反馈，测试输入来自概率状态模型。

Result: 在金融助手聊天机器人测试中，Neo发现边缘案例故障的效率接近人类专家，且吞吐量提高10-12倍。

Conclusion: Neo为可扩展、自进化的LLM质量评估奠定了基础，其框架模型无关且可扩展。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive
behaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing
obsolete.
  We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates
realistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question
Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing
domain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed
modularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning
dialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like
conversations that adapt after every turn.
  Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i)
uncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break
rate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered
10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45
mins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic
policies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader
behavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts.
  Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent
interfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and
extensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release
the framework to facilitate reproducible, high-fidelity testing of emerging
agentic systems.

Result: 评估了20个商用LLM在10个安全领域的表现，结果显示性能差异显著（平均安全分数52.4%至86.2%），复杂领域表现较差（如隐私与冒充领域平均24.3%）。

Conclusion: LLM的安全性具有不一致性和情境依赖性，需要可扩展的定制化工具（如Aymara AI）支持负责任的AI开发和监管。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, scalable and rigorous safety evaluation is essential.
This paper introduces Aymara AI, a programmatic platform for generating and
administering customized, policy-grounded safety evaluations. Aymara AI
transforms natural-language safety policies into adversarial prompts and scores
model responses using an AI-based rater validated against human judgments. We
demonstrate its capabilities through the Aymara LLM Risk and Responsibility
Matrix, which evaluates 20 commercially available LLMs across 10 real-world
safety domains. Results reveal wide performance disparities, with mean safety
scores ranging from 86.2% to 52.4%. While models performed well in
well-established safety domains such as Misinformation (mean = 95.7%), they
consistently failed in more complex or underspecified domains, notably Privacy
& Impersonation (mean = 24.3%). Analyses of Variance confirmed that safety
scores differed significantly across both models and domains (p < .05). These
findings underscore the inconsistent and context-dependent nature of LLM safety
and highlight the need for scalable, customizable tools like Aymara AI to
support responsible AI development and oversight.

Abstract: Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately
of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning
presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. This paper
conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes
land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric
constraints. We survey how generative AI approaches, including VAEs, GANs,
transformers, and diffusion models, reshape urban design. We further identify
critical gaps: 1) limited research on integrating urban theory guidance, 2)
limited research of AI urban planning over multiple spatial resolutions or
angularities, 3) limited research on augmenting urban design knowledge from
data, and 4) limited research on addressing real-world interactions. To address
these limitations, we outline future research directions in theory-guided
generation, digital twins, and human-machine co-design, calling for a new
synthesis of generative intelligence and participatory urbanism.

Result: 框架在多任务中成功训练代理，展示了其高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: AgentFly为LM代理与RL的结合提供了系统化解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have gained significant attention for their
ability to autonomously complete tasks through interactions with environments,
tools, and APIs. LM agents are primarily built with prompt engineering or
supervised finetuning. At the same time, reinforcement learning (RL) has been
explored to enhance LM's capabilities, such as reasoning and factuality.
However, the combination of the LM agents and reinforcement learning (Agent-RL)
remains underexplored and lacks systematic study. To this end, we built
AgentFly, a scalable and extensible Agent-RL framework designed to empower LM
agents with a variety of RL algorithms. Our framework supports multi-turn
interactions by adapting traditional RL methods with token-level masking. It
features a decorator-based interface for defining tools and reward functions,
enabling seamless extension and ease of use. To support high-throughput
training, we implement asynchronous execution of tool calls and reward
computations, and design a centralized resource management system for scalable
environment coordination. We also provide a suite of prebuilt tools and
environments, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness through successful
agent training across multiple tasks.

Result: 在GDXray+数据集上，InsightX Agent实现了96.35%的F1分数，显著提升了分析的可解释性和可信度。

Conclusion: InsightX Agent展示了基于LMM的框架在工业检测任务中的变革潜力。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for
industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often
lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical
self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address
these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based
agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive
X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent
positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,
coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the
Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect
region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in
X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides
the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating
context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,
confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the
SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using
tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,
enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate
diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset
demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection
F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and
trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of
agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

*Xiao Yang,Juxi Leitner,Michael Burke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在马尔可夫决策过程中的表现，发现其在简单环境中表现优于传统强化学习方法，但在复杂环境中需要进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在自主决策中的适用性，尤其是其利用预训练知识快速适应的能力。

Method: 采用在线结构化提示策略，比较LLMs与传统强化学习在序列决策任务中的零样本表现。

Result: LLMs在简单环境中初始表现更好，但在复杂环境中规划和推理能力不足，反馈机制可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究混合策略、微调和高级记忆集成以提升LLMs的决策能力。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract context from natural
language problem descriptions naturally raises questions about their
suitability in autonomous decision-making settings. This paper studies the
behaviour of these models within a Markov Decision Process (MDPs). While
traditional reinforcement learning (RL) strategies commonly employed in this
setting rely on iterative exploration, LLMs, pre-trained on diverse datasets,
offer the capability to leverage prior knowledge for faster adaptation. We
investigate online structured prompting strategies in sequential decision
making tasks, comparing the zero-shot performance of LLM-based approaches to
that of classical RL methods. Our findings reveal that although LLMs
demonstrate improved initial performance in simpler environments, they struggle
with planning and reasoning in complex scenarios without fine-tuning or
additional guidance. Our results show that feedback mechanisms, intended to
improve decision-making, often introduce confusion, leading to diminished
performance in intricate environments. These insights underscore the need for
further exploration into hybrid strategies, fine-tuning, and advanced memory
integration to enhance LLM-based decision-making capabilities.

TL;DR: 《Endless Tuning》是一种基于双重镜像过程的人工智能可靠部署设计方法，旨在避免人类被取代并填补责任缺口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能部署中的人类替代问题和责任缺口问题。

Method: 采用双重镜像过程，通过三个原型应用（贷款审批、肺炎诊断和艺术风格识别）测试协议，并关注用户体验。

Result: 实验显示用户对决策过程有完全控制感，同时实现了责任与问责的桥梁。

Conclusion: 该方法在技术选择和伦理层面提供了新视角，强调用户体验而非统计准确性。

Abstract: The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial
intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals
of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap
(Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the
relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol,
implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making
processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style
recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step
illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice
(Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical
account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of
XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results
of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical
accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was
perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared
that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of
damage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球老龄化趋势需要创新护理策略，代理AI有望通过自主决策提升老年人独立生活能力。

Method: 分析了代理AI在老年护理中的独特能力、应用和限制，结合文献综述和交互式仪表盘。

Result: 代理AI可显著改善老年护理，但需解决隐私、安全和伦理问题。

Conclusion: 需推动以人为中心的代理AI研究，平衡潜力与挑战，确保其在老年护理中的负责任使用。

Abstract: The global ageing population necessitates new and emerging strategies for
caring for older adults. In this article, we explore the potential for
transformation in elderly care through Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI),
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We discuss the proactive and
autonomous decision-making facilitated by Agentic AI in elderly care.
Personalized tracking of health, cognitive care, and environmental management,
all aimed at enhancing independence and high-level living for older adults,
represents important areas of application. With a potential for significant
transformation of elderly care, Agentic AI also raises profound concerns about
data privacy and security, decision independence, and access. We share key
insights to emphasize the need for ethical safeguards, privacy protections, and
transparent decision-making. Our goal in this article is to provide a balanced
discussion of both the potential and the challenges associated with Agentic AI,
and to provide insights into its responsible use in elderly care, to bring
Agentic AI into harmony with the requirements and vulnerabilities specific to
the elderly. Finally, we identify the priorities for the academic research
communities, to achieve human-centered advancements and integration of Agentic
AI in elderly care. To the best of our knowledge, this is no existing study
that reviews the role of Agentic AI in elderly care. Hence, we address the
literature gap by analyzing the unique capabilities, applications, and
limitations of LLM-based Agentic AI in elderly care. We also provide a
companion interactive dashboard at https://hazratali.github.io/agenticai/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 溯因推理在人工智能和数据库更新中有广泛应用，但复杂的计数和枚举问题具有高计算挑战性，因此需要更细粒度的推理方法。

Method: 引入“facet”概念，即出现在部分解释中但非全部解释中的文字，并分析其在Post框架中的复杂性。

Result: 通过facet和解释间距离的分析，提供了对解释异质性和同质性的更深入理解。

Conclusion: facet为命题溯因提供了更细粒度的分析工具，有助于理解解释的多样性，同时保持了较低的复杂性。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning is a popular non-monotonic paradigm that aims to explain
observed symptoms and manifestations. It has many applications, such as
diagnosis and planning in artificial intelligence and database updates. In
propositional abduction, we focus on specifying knowledge by a propositional
formula. The computational complexity of tasks in propositional abduction has
been systematically characterized - even with detailed classifications for
Boolean fragments. Unsurprisingly, the most insightful reasoning problems
(counting and enumeration) are computationally highly challenging. Therefore,
we consider reasoning between decisions and counting, allowing us to understand
explanations better while maintaining favorable complexity. We introduce facets
to propositional abductions, which are literals that occur in some explanation
(relevant) but not all explanations (dispensable). Reasoning with facets
provides a more fine-grained understanding of variability in explanations
(heterogeneous). In addition, we consider the distance between two
explanations, enabling a better understanding of heterogeneity/homogeneity. We
comprehensively analyze facets of propositional abduction in various settings,
including an almost complete characterization in Post's framework.

*Yi Zhang,An Zhang,XiuYu Zhang,Leheng Sheng,Yuxin Chen,Zhenkai Liang,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaAlign是一个基于纯强化学习的框架，通过可验证的安全奖励激励模型的内在安全意识，解决了现有安全对齐方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法存在浅层拒绝或依赖密集监督的问题，未能充分利用模型的内在安全意识。

Method: AlphaAlign采用双奖励系统：可验证安全奖励鼓励对有害查询的正确拒绝，标准化帮助性奖励指导良性输入的高质量响应。

Result: AlphaAlign在简单性、效率、安全与实用性平衡以及深度对齐方面表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: AlphaAlign通过主动安全推理，提升了模型的安全性和实用性，同时减少了过度拒绝问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding
from their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful
content and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after
safety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial
refusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based
approaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety
self-awareness. We propose \textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure
reinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to
incentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.}
AlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages
correctly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while
penalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides
high-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop
proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised
safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages:
(1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and
minimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility
trade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals,
while simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and
robustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety
reasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on
shallow refusal patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在智能时代，心理测量测试在人员选拔、职业发展和心理健康评估中日益重要。强制选择测试因其能降低回答失真的风险而常用于人格评估，但传统模型存在局限性。

Method: 通过非线性映射挖掘参与者和项目特征，利用多层神经网络建模其交互，并引入单调性假设以提高诊断结果的可解释性。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的实验表明，FCNCD具有较高的准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FCNCD模型克服了传统模型的限制，适用于强制选择测试中的三种常见项目块类型，为心理测量提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: In the smart era, psychometric tests are becoming increasingly important for
personnel selection, career development, and mental health assessment.
Forced-choice tests are common in personality assessments because they require
participants to select from closely related options, lowering the risk of
response distortion. This study presents a deep learning-based Forced-Choice
Neural Cognitive Diagnostic Model (FCNCD) that overcomes the limitations of
traditional models and is applicable to the three most common item block types
found in forced-choice tests. To account for the unidimensionality of items in
forced-choice tests, we create interpretable participant and item parameters.
We model the interactions between participant and item features using
multilayer neural networks after mining them using nonlinear mapping. In
addition, we use the monotonicity assumption to improve the interpretability of
the diagnostic results. The FCNCD's effectiveness is validated by experiments
on real-world and simulated datasets that show its accuracy, interpretability,
and robustness.

*Jerry Wang,Fang Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于差分进化（DE）的方法，优化对抗性提示后缀以攻击RAG系统，实验证明其效果优于现有方法，并能逃逸检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性提示攻击会显著降低RAG系统的可靠性，因此需要一种梯度无关的方法来优化对抗性后缀。

Method: 使用差分进化（DE）优化对抗性提示后缀，将RAG系统视为黑盒，通过进化候选后缀来最大化目标错误文档的检索排名。

Result: 在BEIR QA数据集上的实验表明，DE方法在少量标记（<=5）下优于GGPP和PRADA，且能逃逸BERT检测器。

Conclusion: DE方法在对抗性提示优化中表现出色，同时通过可读性策略提高了隐蔽性。

Abstract: Adversarial prompt attacks can significantly alter the reliability of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by re-ranking them to produce
incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a novel method that applies
Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize adversarial prompt suffixes for
RAG-based question answering. Our approach is gradient-free, treating the RAG
pipeline as a black box and evolving a population of candidate suffixes to
maximize the retrieval rank of a targeted incorrect document to be closer to
real world scenarios. We conducted experiments on the BEIR QA datasets to
evaluate attack success at certain retrieval rank thresholds under multiple
retrieving applications. Our results demonstrate that DE-based prompt
optimization attains competitive (and in some cases higher) success rates
compared to GGPP to dense retrievers and PRADA to sparse retrievers, while
using only a small number of tokens (<=5 tokens) in the adversarial suffix.
Furthermore, we introduce a readability-aware suffix construction strategy,
validated by a statistically significant reduction in MLM negative
log-likelihood with Welch's t-test. Through evaluations with a BERT-based
adversarial suffix detector, we show that DE-generated suffixes evade
detection, yielding near-chance detection accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果推理的内在奖励机制CAIS，通过量化动作对感官结果的影响，解决了传统强化学习在噪声环境中的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类婴儿能有效发现自身的因果效能，而传统强化学习代理在噪声环境中表现脆弱，依赖相关性奖励容易失败。

Method: 引入Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS)，通过计算动作条件分布与基线分布的1-Wasserstein距离，量化动作的因果影响。

Result: 在模拟婴儿-移动环境中，CAIS能有效过滤噪声并学习正确策略，同时重现了“消退爆发”现象。

Conclusion: 显式推断因果关系是发展稳健代理感的关键，为自适应自主系统提供了心理学合理的框架。

Abstract: While human infants robustly discover their own causal efficacy, standard
reinforcement learning agents remain brittle, as their reliance on
correlation-based rewards fails in noisy, ecologically valid scenarios. To
address this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel
intrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's
influence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned
distribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the
baseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward
that isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.
We test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where
correlation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is
subjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to
filter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.
Furthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our
agent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the
"extinction burst" phenomenon. We conclude that explicitly inferring causality
is a crucial mechanism for developing a robust sense of agency, offering a
psychologically plausible framework for more adaptive autonomous systems.

Abstract: Standard automated planning employs first-order formulas under closed-world

We follow a line of research that aims to incorporate background knowledge into
automated planning problems, for example, by means of ontologies, which are
usually interpreted under open-world semantics. We present a new approach for
planning with DL-Lite ontologies that combines the advantages of ontology-based
action conditions provided by explicit-input knowledge and action bases (eKABs)
and ontology-aware action effects under the coherence update semantics. We show
that the complexity of the resulting formalism is not higher than that of
previous approaches and provide an implementation via a polynomial compilation
into classical planning. An evaluation of existing and new benchmarks examines
the performance of a planning system on different variants of our compilation.

Motivation: 口腔疾病诊断复杂且症状重叠，需要超越简单模式匹配的临床推理工具。

Method: 整合多模态CLIP模型和ChatGLM-6B语言模型，采用HDRT框架，提供快速筛查和标准交互诊断两种模式。

Result: 在431张内部测试图像上，快速模式准确率73.4%，标准模式提升至89.5%。

Conclusion: CSI通过分层推理显著提升诊断准确性，为临床提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The diagnosis of oral diseases presents a problematic clinical challenge,
characterized by a wide spectrum of pathologies with overlapping
symptomatology. To address this, we developed Clinical Semantic Intelligence
(CSI), a novel artificial intelligence framework that diagnoses 118 different
oral diseases by computationally modeling the cognitive processes of an expert
clinician. Our core hypothesis is that moving beyond simple pattern matching to
emulate expert reasoning is critical to building clinically useful diagnostic
aids.
  CSI's architecture integrates a fine-tuned multimodal CLIP model with a
specialized ChatGLM-6B language model. This system executes a Hierarchical
Diagnostic Reasoning Tree (HDRT), a structured framework that distills the
systematic, multi-step logic of differential diagnosis. The framework operates
in two modes: a Fast Mode for rapid screening and a Standard Mode that
leverages the full HDRT for an interactive and in-depth diagnostic workup.
  To train and validate our system, we curated a primary dataset of 4,310
images, supplemented by an external hold-out set of 176 images for final
validation. A clinically-informed augmentation strategy expanded our training
data to over 30,000 image-text pairs. On a 431-image internal test set, CSI's
Fast Mode achieved an accuracy of 73.4%, which increased to 89.5% with the
HDRT-driven Standard Mode. The performance gain is directly attributable to the
hierarchical reasoning process. Herein, we detail the architectural philosophy,
development, and rigorous evaluation of the CSI framework.

Result: 实验显示，AI集成架构下，平均通勤时间为7.8至8.4分钟，满意度超过89%，可达性指数超过91%。移除智能模块会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: The Line中的自由移动在概念和操作上均可实现，但需依赖自适应AI系统、可持续基础设施和实时反馈。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a
proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess
whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we
develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling,
reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The
simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical
levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world
traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full
AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to
8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index
of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies
confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement
learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with
commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70
percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and
minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest
that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but
also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable
infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.

Conclusion: 通用LLM在有效代理结构指导下具备未开发的定理证明潜力，为形式化环境中的自动推理提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success
in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning
tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning. However, generating formal
proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for
these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and
automated verification. Current approaches typically require specializing
models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs
for data collection and training. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta
Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a
general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment. Delta Prover leverages
the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to
interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for
model specialization. At its core, the agent integrates two novel,
interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective
decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language
(DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \textbf{Delta
Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test
benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model
specialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger
test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies.
Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by
an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving
capabilities. This presents a computationally efficient alternative to
specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.

Abstract: Novel AI-based arc fault diagnosis models have demonstrated outstanding
performance in terms of classification accuracy. However, an inherent problem
is whether these models can actually be trusted to find arc faults. In this
light, this work proposes a soft evaluation indicator that explains the outputs
of arc fault diagnosis models, by defining the the correct explanation of arc
faults and leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and real arc fault
experiments. Meanwhile, a lightweight balanced neural network is proposed to
guarantee competitive accuracy and soft feature extraction score. In our
experiments, several traditional machine learning methods and deep learning
methods across two arc fault datasets with different sample times and noise
levels are utilized to test the effectiveness of the soft evaluation indicator.
Through this approach, the arc fault diagnosis models are easy to understand
and trust, allowing practitioners to make informed and trustworthy decisions.

Abstract: Multimodal graphs, which integrate unstructured heterogeneous data with
structured interconnections, offer substantial real-world utility but remain
insufficiently explored in unsupervised learning. In this work, we initiate the
study of multimodal graph clustering, aiming to bridge this critical gap.
Through empirical analysis, we observe that real-world multimodal graphs often
exhibit hybrid neighborhood patterns, combining both homophilic and
heterophilic relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
framework -- \textsc{Disentangled Multimodal Graph Clustering (DMGC)} -- which
decomposes the original hybrid graph into two complementary views: (1) a
homophily-enhanced graph that captures cross-modal class consistency, and (2)
heterophily-aware graphs that preserve modality-specific inter-class
distinctions. We introduce a \emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism
that jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy,
enabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion.
Our self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process
without requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and
multi-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Uncnbb/DMGC.

multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces
IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs),
designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat
integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables,
manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process
condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from
environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and
context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat
ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed
across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance
and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using
GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results
indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly
in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. Overall, these findings demonstrate the
viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and
establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted
decision support in manufacturing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型AI系统漏洞类别——认知退化，并提出了Qorvex安全AI框架（QSAF Domain 10）作为防御模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗性外部威胁（如提示注入）无法解决AI系统内部产生的认知退化问题，如内存饥饿、规划递归等，导致逻辑崩溃和幻觉。

Method: 通过六阶段认知退化生命周期和七个运行时控制（QSAF-BC-001至BC-007），实时监控并缓解问题。

Result: QSAF框架能够检测疲劳、饥饿和角色崩溃，并通过实时控制实现主动防御。

Conclusion: 认知退化是AI系统的新漏洞类别，QSAF框架为首个跨平台防御模型，提升了AI系统的行为与认知韧性。

Abstract: We introduce Cognitive Degradation as a novel vulnerability class in agentic
AI systems. Unlike traditional adversarial external threats such as prompt
injection, these failures originate internally, arising from memory starvation,
planner recursion, context flooding, and output suppression. These systemic
weaknesses lead to silent agent drift, logic collapse, and persistent
hallucinations over time. To address this class of failures, we introduce the
Qorvex Security AI Framework for Behavioral & Cognitive Resilience (QSAF Domain
10), a lifecycle-aware defense framework defined by a six-stage cognitive
degradation lifecycle. The framework includes seven runtime controls
(QSAF-BC-001 to BC-007) that monitor agent subsystems in real time and trigger
proactive mitigation through fallback routing, starvation detection, and memory
integrity enforcement. Drawing from cognitive neuroscience, we map agentic
architectures to human analogs, enabling early detection of fatigue,
starvation, and role collapse. By introducing a formal lifecycle and real-time
mitigation controls, this work establishes Cognitive Degradation as a critical
new class of AI system vulnerability and proposes the first cross-platform
defense model for resilient agentic behavior.

### [266] [One Step is Enough: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on One-Step Policy Optimization for Order Dispatch on Ride-Sharing Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15351)
*Zijian Zhao,Sen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法（GRPO和OSPO）解决共享乘车平台中多智能体强化学习（MARL）的价值函数估计问题，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享乘车平台需动态匹配乘客与车辆，但传统MARL方法因依赖准确的价值函数估计在不确定环境中表现不佳。

Method: 1. 将GRPO应用于共享乘车，用组平均奖励替代PPO基线以减少估计误差；2. 提出OSPO，利用一步奖励训练最优策略。

Result: 在曼哈顿真实数据集上，GRPO和OSPO在多数场景下表现优越，优化了接客时间和订单完成量。

Conclusion: GRPO和OSPO通过绕过价值函数估计，显著提升了共享乘车平台的匹配效率和稳定性。

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms face the fundamental challenge of
dynamically bundling passengers with diverse origins and destinations and
matching them with vehicles in real time, all under significant uncertainty.
Recently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging
decentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the
large number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive
state and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing
approaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,
which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.
Specifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,
exacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the
environment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in
value functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative
methods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to
ride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to
eliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired
by GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO
framework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,
the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we
term One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO). Experiments on a real-world Manhattan
ride-hailing dataset demonstrate that both GRPO and OSPO achieve superior
performance across most scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the
number of served orders using simple MLP networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合非参数检索和扩散生成模型的离线强化学习方法RAD，通过动态检索高质量状态并规划，解决了数据集稀疏和轨迹拼接问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习因数据集稀疏和轨迹重叠不足导致长时规划困难，现有方法依赖启发式拼接且泛化能力有限。

Method: RAD结合非参数检索和扩散生成模型，动态检索高回报状态作为目标，并通过条件引导扩散模型规划。

Result: 实验表明RAD在多种基准测试中表现优于基线方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: RAD通过检索引导生成实现了灵活的轨迹拼接，提升了泛化能力，适用于稀疏或分布外状态。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn policies from
fixed datasets, avoiding costly or unsafe environment interactions. However,
its effectiveness is often limited by dataset sparsity and the lack of
transition overlap between suboptimal and expert trajectories, which makes
long-horizon planning particularly challenging. Prior solutions based on
synthetic data augmentation or trajectory stitching often fail to generalize to
novel states and rely on heuristic stitching points. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval High-quAlity Demonstrations (RAD) for
decision-making, which combines non-parametric retrieval with diffusion-based
generative modeling. RAD dynamically retrieves high-return states from the
offline dataset as target states based on state similarity and return
estimation, and plans toward them using a condition-guided diffusion model.
Such retrieval-guided generation enables flexible trajectory stitching and
improves generalization when encountered with underrepresented or
out-of-distribution states. Extensive experiments confirm that RAD achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to baselines across diverse
benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

proposed model employs a graph attention network to encode activities and their
relationships, combined with an LSTM network to handle temporal dependencies.
Evaluated on one reallife and three synthetic event logs, the model
demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 业务过程中，批处理策略需要在成本、处理努力和等待时间之间找到平衡，但目前缺乏自动发现最优策略的方法。

Method: 采用帕累托优化和干预启发式，结合模拟评估，嵌入三种元启发式（爬山法、模拟退火和强化学习）生成最优批处理策略。

Result: 实验评估表明，基于干预启发式的方法在收敛性、多样性和周期时间增益方面优于非启发式基线。

Conclusion: 干预启发式结合帕累托优化能有效发现业务过程中活动批处理的最优策略。

Abstract: In business processes, activity batching refers to packing multiple activity
instances for joint execution. Batching allows managers to trade off cost and
processing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may
lower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they
create longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches
reduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching
policy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each
batch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching
policies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing
effort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts
from a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates
alternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.
Each heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching
policy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or
resource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching
policy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via
simulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization
meta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto
front of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three
meta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement
learning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on
intervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics
baseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of
Pareto-optimal policies.

TL;DR: Chart-R1是一种基于强化学习微调的视觉语言模型，专注于复杂图表推理。通过程序化数据合成和两阶段训练策略，显著提升了图表领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证R1-Style方法在通用多模态数据（如图表）上的优势，填补图表领域推理数据的不足。

Method: 提出程序化数据合成技术生成高质量推理数据，采用两阶段训练策略（Chart-COT和Chart-RFT）。

Result: 在开源基准和自建数据集（ChartRQA）上表现优异，优于图表领域方法，甚至媲美GPT-4o等大型模型。

Conclusion: Chart-R1为复杂图表推理提供了有效解决方案，展示了强化学习在多模态任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based
on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from
the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning
and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their
advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal
data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in
complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain
vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex
chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic
data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning
data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of
reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training
strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and
Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims
to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable
subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for
improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the
typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft
reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity
in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks
and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental
results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain
methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g.,
GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的戏剧生成方法缺乏主动性和环境互动性，限制了在线实时表演的交互性和沉浸感。

Result: 实验评估表明，HAMLET能创造富有表现力和连贯性的戏剧体验。

Conclusion: HAMLET为交互式叙事领域提供了一种新的解决方案，提升了戏剧表演的沉浸感和互动性。

Abstract: Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term
goal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language
model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing
LLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack
initiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,
these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These
limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time
performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent
framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple
topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent
improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given
an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based
on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to
conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of
scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.
The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know
and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the
quality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three
primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and
interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can
create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and
models are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM是否依赖统计关联或构建内部世界模型，以理解其认知能力。

Method: 采用认知科学方法，通过三个研究测试LLM在滑轮系统问题中的表现。

Result: 模型能利用滑轮数量启发式估计机械优势（Study 1），区分功能与非功能系统（Study 2），但无法推理复杂结构连接（Study 3）。

Conclusion: LLM可能具备初步世界模型能力，但缺乏深层推理，认知科学方法有助于评估AI系统。

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) construct and manipulate internal world
models, or do they rely solely on statistical associations represented as
output layer token probabilities? We adapt cognitive science methodologies from
human mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using
TikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical
advantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly
above chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth
MA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates
suggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily
simulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by
probing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models
evaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with
randomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the
functional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could
represent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.
Study 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched
systems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;
LLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.
Insofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion
that LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical
associations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately
represent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may
lack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3). We
conclude by advocating the utility of cognitive scientific methods to evaluate
the world-modeling capacities of artificial intelligence systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，如何利用额外的参数依赖信息提升数据效率是一个关键问题。

Method: 1. 参数化SPI算法利用分布相关性估计转移动态；2. 基于博弈的预处理技术剪枝冗余动作；3. 基于SMT求解的更高级预处理技术。

Result: 实验表明，这些技术将SPI的数据效率提升多个数量级，同时保持可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过利用参数依赖和预处理技术，显著提升了离线强化学习的数据效率。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) is an offline reinforcement learning problem in
which a new policy that reliably outperforms the behavior policy with high
confidence needs to be computed using only a dataset and the behavior policy.
Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard formalism for modeling
environments in SPI. In many applications, additional information in the form
of parametric dependencies between distributions in the transition dynamics is
available. We make SPI more data-efficient by leveraging these dependencies
through three contributions: (1) a parametric SPI algorithm that exploits known
correlations between distributions to more accurately estimate the transition
dynamics using the same amount of data; (2) a preprocessing technique that
prunes redundant actions from the environment through a game-based abstraction;
and (3) a more advanced preprocessing technique, based on satisfiability modulo
theory (SMT) solving, that can identify more actions to prune. Empirical
results and an ablation study show that our techniques increase the data
efficiency of SPI by multiple orders of magnitude while maintaining the same
reliability guarantees.

Motivation: 现有研究未对多选问题评估指标进行全面分析，且存在答案波动问题（模型对提示微小变化产生不同结果），因此需要一种新的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种评估协议，通过分析评估方法与答案波动率及原始性能的关系来评估指标。

Result: 结果显示现有指标与答案波动率有强关联，而最差准确率在新协议中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 最差准确率是一种有效的评估指标，可用于衡量模型在多选问题中的稳定性。

Abstract: Using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) has become a standard for assessing
LLM capabilities efficiently. A variety of metrics can be employed for this
task. However, previous research has not conducted a thorough assessment of
them. At the same time, MCQ evaluation suffers from answer fluctuation: models
produce different results given slight changes in prompts. We suggest a metric
assessment protocol in which evaluation methodologies are analyzed through
their connection with fluctuation rates, as well as original performance. Our
results show that there is a strong link between existing metrics and the
answer changing, even when computed without any additional prompt variants. A
novel metric, worst accuracy, demonstrates the highest association on the
protocol.

Abstract: We present an adapter-based approach for tactical conditioning of StarCraft
II AI agents. Current agents, while powerful, lack the ability to adapt their
strategies based on high-level tactical directives. Our method freezes a
pre-trained policy network (DI-Star) and attaches lightweight adapter modules
to each action head, conditioned on a tactical tensor that encodes strategic
preferences. By training these adapters with KL divergence constraints, we
ensure the policy maintains core competencies while exhibiting tactical
variations. Experimental results show our approach successfully modulates agent
behavior across tactical dimensions including aggression, expansion patterns,
and technology preferences, while maintaining competitive performance. Our
method enables flexible tactical control with minimal computational overhead,
offering practical strategy customization for complex real-time strategy games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话式AI系统在诊断对话中表现出潜力，但实际应用中需要确保患者安全，且诊断和治疗计划通常由持牌专业人员监督。

Method: 提出g-AMIE系统，通过多智能体框架在限定范围内进行病史采集，避免提供个性化医疗建议，并将评估结果传递给监督医生。

Conclusion: 异步监督是一种可行的模式，可让诊断AI系统在专家监督下运行，提升实际医疗质量。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for
diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that
providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated
activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee
other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or
physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework
for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence
Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent
system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from
individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an
overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The
PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.
This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen
asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical
Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we
compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across
60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality
intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the
overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.
PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP
consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing
clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our
results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible
paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for
enhancing real-world care.

Motivation: 解决大型推理模型因过度生成token而导致的效率问题，将推理长度控制从外部约束转化为模型内在能力。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习：第一阶段学习成功解长度的统计分布，第二阶段将这些模式作为元认知指导嵌入推理上下文。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，LAPO减少40.9%的token使用，同时提高2.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: LAPO使模型能够根据问题复杂度动态分配计算资源，实现高效且高质量的推理。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended
chain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive
token generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy
Optimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control
from an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing
approaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO
enables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth
through a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models
learn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of
successful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as
meta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning
context to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\%
while improving accuracy by 2.3\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained
with LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based
on problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing
quality.

solutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to
maintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models
(LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain
compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and
requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent,
the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines
compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new
patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four
specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate
in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements.
Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent
successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas
savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with
existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation
studies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts
generated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that
GasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from
4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for
LLM-assisted smart contract development.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多智能体意图的动态可解释涌现分析框架EAMI，用于复杂服务生态系统中的异常涌现分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着服务计算、云计算和物联网的发展，服务生态系统日益复杂，传统因果方法难以分析智能体间的异常涌现行为。

Method: EAMI采用双视角思维跟踪机制（Inspector Agent和Analysis Agent）提取智能体意图，结合k-means聚类和意图时间涌现图进行动态分析。

Result: 实验在复杂O2O服务系统和Stanford AI Town中验证了EAMI的有效性、通用性和效率。

Conclusion: EAMI为服务生态系统中的异常涌现和因果分析提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the rise of service computing, cloud computing, and IoT, service
ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex. The intricate interactions among
intelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional
causal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer
new possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain
limited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework:
Emergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic
and interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective
thought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract
agent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means
clustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by
a Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments
validate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the
Stanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its
effectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency. This framework provides a
novel paradigm for abnormal emergence and causal analysis in service
ecosystems. The code is available at

Conclusion: 尽管FL在隐私保护方面具有潜力，但要完全满足TAI的要求仍需解决分布式特性带来的挑战，未来研究需进一步探索这些方向。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI)
has emerged as a critical objective in the deployment of AI systems across
sensitive and high-risk domains. TAI frameworks articulate a comprehensive set
of ethical, legal, and technical requirements to ensure that AI technologies
are aligned with human values, rights, and societal expectations. Among the
various AI paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising solution to
pressing privacy concerns. However, aligning FL with the rest of the
requirements of TAI presents a series of challenges, most of which arise from
its inherently distributed nature. In this work, we adopt the requirements TAI
as a guiding structure to systematically analyze the challenges of adapting FL
to TAI. Specifically, we classify and examine the key obstacles to aligning FL
with TAI, providing a detailed exploration of what has been done, the trends,
and the remaining work within each of the identified challenges.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在已知最大定向部分有向无环图（MPDAG）的情况下，如何识别条件因果效应，并提供了三种结果：不受治疗影响的调节集识别公式、MPDAG设置下的do calculus推广，以及识别这些条件效应的完整算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在MPDAG框架下识别条件因果效应的问题，以解决背景知识限制和所有变量可观测的因果模型中的挑战。

Method: 提出了三种方法：1）不受治疗影响的调节集识别公式；2）将do calculus推广到MPDAG设置；3）开发了识别条件效应的完整算法。

Result: 成功推导了识别条件因果效应的公式，扩展了do calculus，并提供了完整的算法支持。

Conclusion: 论文为MPDAG框架下的条件因果效应识别提供了理论和方法支持，扩展了现有因果推断工具的应用范围。

Abstract: We consider identifying a conditional causal effect when a graph is known up
to a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG). An MPDAG
represents an equivalence class of graphs that is restricted by background
knowledge and where all variables in the causal model are observed. We provide
three results that address identification in this setting: an identification
formula when the conditioning set is unaffected by treatment, a generalization
of the well-known do calculus to the MPDAG setting, and an algorithm that is
complete for identifying these conditional effects.

TL;DR: HBPO是一种强化学习框架，通过分层预算探索和差异化奖励机制，使模型能根据问题复杂度自适应调整推理深度，显著减少计算资源使用并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型因统一推理策略导致的低效问题，探索如何在保持能力的同时优化推理效率。

Method: 采用分层预算探索，将样本分组并分配不同预算，结合差异化奖励机制，使模型能根据问题复杂度调整推理深度。

Result: 实验显示HBPO在四个推理基准上平均减少60.6%的token使用，同时准确率提升3.14%。

Conclusion: 推理效率与能力并非矛盾，通过分层训练可同时优化两者，模型能自适应调整推理深度。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive
chain-of-thought generation, yet exhibit significant computational inefficiency
by applying uniform reasoning strategies regardless of problem complexity. We
present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement
learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning
depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge
of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties
on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long
reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach
partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets,
aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of
capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create
budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing
models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and
computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces
average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across
four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external
constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive
behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem
complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are
not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through
appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration
diversity.

Result: 发现LLMs自发建立主观时间参考点，神经元对数编码时间距离，训练语料具有非线性时间结构。

Conclusion: 提出体验主义视角理解LLMs认知，强调AI对齐需关注内部表征构建。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain
cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified
in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on
temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find
that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference
point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance
logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To
uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses
across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify
a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits
minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a
logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing
representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where
years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal
orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we
found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear
temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal
construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for
understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a
subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational
system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien
cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a
direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions. Our
code is available at https://TheOtherMind.github.io.
