### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多级专家混合模型（MMoE）来解决多模态实体链接中的提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题，通过结合大语言模型和多模态特征提取，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能解决提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题，限制了多模态实体链接的效果。

Method: MMoE包含四个模块：描述感知提及增强、多模态特征提取、层内和层间专家混合，动态选择信息。

Result: 实验表明MMoE在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态选择和增强机制有效解决了多模态实体链接中的关键问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于协方差的像素-文本损失（CoPT），利用领域无关的文本嵌入来学习图像分割编码器中的领域不变特征，显著提升了无监督领域自适应（UDA）在语义分割中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割中标注数据难以获取，而现有UDA方法未充分利用文本的领域无关特性。

Method: 通过LLM生成源和目标领域描述，结合冻结的CLIP模型生成文本嵌入，并设计CoPT损失学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CoPT模型达到了UDA分割的最新性能。

Conclusion: CoPT通过文本嵌入有效提升了UDA分割的领域适应性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [3] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Recall框架，通过多模态对抗输入测试图像生成模型的去学习鲁棒性，揭示现有方法的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图像生成模型（如Stable Diffusion）能力强大，但其可能生成有害或侵权内容，去学习技术被提出以解决这一问题，但其鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出Recall框架，利用多模态条件优化对抗图像提示，测试十种去学习方法的鲁棒性。

Result: Recall在对抗效果、计算效率和语义保真度上均优于现有基线，揭示了去学习机制的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 现有去学习技术存在漏洞，需更鲁棒的解决方案以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该综述全面总结了可解释人工智能（XAI）在生物医学图像分析中的应用，填补了现有研究在模态感知视角、多模态和视觉语言范式方面的不足，并提供了实践指导和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学图像分析中，XAI的透明性和可信度对临床采用至关重要，但现有综述缺乏模态感知视角和实际指导。

Method: 通过系统分类XAI方法，提出模态中心分类法，分析多模态学习和视觉语言模型的作用，并总结评估指标和开源框架。

Result: 提供了针对不同成像类型的XAI方法分类，强调了多模态和视觉语言模型的重要性，并总结了评估工具和挑战。

Conclusion: 该综述为生物医学图像分析中可解释深度学习的发展提供了深入基础和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [5] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉现象，特别是由模态冲突引起的幻觉。作者提出了三种缓解方法，并在构建的数据集MMMC上验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但在实际场景中容易产生幻觉。本文从模态冲突的角度探讨这一现象，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过提示工程、监督微调和强化学习三种方法缓解模态冲突导致的幻觉，并在MMMC数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，强化学习方法在缓解模态冲突导致的幻觉中表现最佳，监督微调方法也展现出稳定且良好的性能。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了模态冲突对MLLMs幻觉的影响，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [6] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在GNSS不可用环境下，利用YOLOv8模型和特征匹配技术实现自主海上目标船只识别与定位的方法，并在MBZIRC2023竞赛中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS不可用的环境中，自主海上监视和目标船只识别对于搜索救援和威胁检测等应用至关重要。当目标船只仅通过视觉线索描述且位置未知时，无人机需依赖机载视觉在严格计算限制下扫描大范围区域。

Method: 结合YOLOv8目标检测模型检测视野内所有船只，通过特征匹配和色调直方图距离分析确定目标船只，并利用简单几何原理进行定位。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023竞赛的实际实验中验证了方法的有效性，同时评估了视角对检测精度和定位准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法在GNSS不可用环境下能够有效识别和定位目标船只，为自主海上监视提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [7] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp是一种基于对比学习的息肉分割网络，通过自监督策略提升特征提取能力，无需额外标注，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖额外标注数据和任务相似性，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 采用对比学习增强特征提取，引入MASPP和CA模块优化多尺度特征融合和边界重建。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，IoU指标显著提升。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp在临床息肉分割任务中具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

### [8] [Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157)
*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过EEG信号与多级语义描述对齐的方法，实现了从脑电信号到图像的先进视觉解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用EEG信号解码视觉体验，克服其空间细节不足的限制，同时为神经科学和可解释AI提供新方法。

Method: 通过对比学习将EEG信号映射到多级语义描述（由大语言模型生成），并利用预训练的潜在扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码，揭示了EEG信号与语义描述的神经认知路径对齐。

Conclusion: 通过结构化语义中介，实现了与认知对齐的EEG视觉解码，展示了语义层次在脑电信号解码中的重要性。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了当前视频生成模型的局限性，提出了改进长视频生成的方法，并构建了新的分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在生成长视频时存在角色一致性和场景布局问题，且多主题长视频的表现不佳。

Method: 通过研究32篇论文，识别关键架构和训练策略，并构建分类法。

Result: 提出了改进长视频生成的方法，并提供了分类表和性能比较。

Conclusion: 论文为长视频生成提供了新的研究方向和改进策略。

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [10] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于颜色的轻量级方法CSCI，用于解决衣物更换重识别（CC-ReID）中的外观偏差问题，无需额外标注或模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外模型或标注学习衣物不变特征，资源消耗大。本文探索颜色作为轻量级代理，解决外观偏差。

Method: 提出CSCI方法，利用RGB信息直接学习颜色相关偏差（Color See）并分离身份特征（Color Ignore），引入S2A自注意力防止信息泄露。

Result: 在四个CC-ReID数据集上验证，图像ReID提升Top-1 2.9%（LTCC）和5.0%（PRCC），视频ReID提升1.0%（CCVID）和2.5%（MeVID）。

Conclusion: 颜色是一种低成本有效代理，可解决CC-ReID中的外观偏差问题。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VFX制作中掩码生成慢且资源密集的问题。

Method: 结合文本提示的灵活目标检测、逐帧图像分割和鲁棒视频跟踪，确保时间一致性。

Result: 减少了人工操作，加速了初步合成的创建，提供了全面的分割数据。

Conclusion: 该流程显著提升了VFX制作的效率，并快速被艺术家采用。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

### [12] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态语言引导框架DisenQ，通过结构化文本监督解决活动生物识别中的特征纠缠问题，并在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物识别在多样化活动中因身份线索与运动动态和外观变化纠缠而复杂化，现有视觉数据方法存在提取不准确问题。

Method: 提出DisenQ框架，利用结构化语言指导解耦生物特征、运动和非生物特征，避免身份线索受外观和运动变化影响。

Result: 在三个活动视频基准测试中取得最优性能，并在传统视频识别基准测试中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DisenQ框架通过语言指导有效解耦特征，显著提升了活动生物识别的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinguaMark是一个用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多语言视觉问答任务中的基准测试，覆盖11种语言和5种社会属性。研究发现闭源模型表现最佳，开源模型如Qwen2.5在多语言泛化上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMMs在多语言覆盖上存在偏差和不公平输出，缺乏对多语言能力的评估。

Method: 提出LinguaMark基准测试，包含6,875个图像-文本对，评估指标包括偏差、答案相关性和忠实性。

Result: 闭源模型整体表现最佳，开源模型Qwen2.5在多语言泛化上表现优异。

Conclusion: 发布基准测试和评估代码以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型是否真正进行视觉推理仍不明确，MagiC旨在填补这一评估空白。

Method: MagiC包含5500个弱监督QA示例和900个人工标注示例，评估15个模型在四个维度上的表现。

Result: 分析揭示了当前视觉推理方法的关键局限和机会。

Conclusion: MagiC为评估和改进视觉语言模型的推理能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ADIEE方法，用于自动生成数据集并训练评分模型，以评估指令引导的图像编辑效果，显著优于现有开源和专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在评估指令引导的图像编辑时存在对齐问题、透明度和成本效率不足，且缺乏公开训练数据集。

Method: 通过ADIEE方法生成大规模数据集（超10万样本），并微调LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型，使其输出自定义数值评分。

Result: 评分模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，与人类评分的相关性提升17.24%，比较准确率最高提升9.35%。

Conclusion: 该评分模型可作为奖励模型，显著提升图像编辑模型的评估分数，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the

propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉叙事系统在跨帧识别同一角色或对象时表现不佳，导致引用不一致和幻觉问题，缺乏明确的跨帧实体连接训练。

Method: 采用对比强化学习框架，扩展Story Reasoning数据集并引入合成负例，使用Direct Preference Optimization和双组件奖励函数优化Qwen Storyteller模型。

Result: 模型在grounding mAP（+14.8%）、F1（+17.1%）和跨帧实体持久性（+13.7%）等方面均有显著提升，结构化故事比例增加23.3%。

Conclusion: 对比强化学习方法有效提升了视觉叙事系统中实体跨帧一致性和故事结构化程度。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D
maps by integrating flood extent and depth for effective disaster management
and urban planning. The survey categorizes deep learning techniques into task

flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,
fostering improved flood management strategies.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出优异的泛化能力，适应不同场景和深度稀疏性。

Conclusion: PacGDC为深度完成提供了一种高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏自适应能力，无法根据局部几何特征调整粒子配置，影响复杂解剖变异的准确表示。

Method: 提出两种机制：(1)新型邻域对应损失以提高适应性，(2)测地线对应算法以优化一致性。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性，分析了适应性与对应性的权衡。

Conclusion: 新方法在表面表示精度和对应性指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Conclusion: MSAGSM是一种轻量级即插即用模块，能有效提升PES任务性能，并引入新数据集TTA推动领域发展。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 现有运动转移方法主要关注人类运动，忽略了动物特有的习惯行为，因此需要一种能够保持动物习惯的运动转移方法。

Result: 通过新数据集DeformingThings4D-skl和实验验证了模型在保持动物习惯运动转移上的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了跨类别动物运动转移中习惯行为保持的问题，为动画和虚拟现实应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Result: 实验表明，Seg-Wild在分割和重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild为无约束场景的分割提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Conclusion: EscherNet++在较小数据集和批量下实现SOTA结果，具有高效和可扩展的3D重建能力。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Conclusion: EPIC是一种高效的多模态交互策略，适用于文本-图像分类任务。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and

diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its

Conclusion: DSANet通过双语义感知机制有效解决了超声视频分割中的噪声问题，同时提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

*Jeonghoon Song,Sunghun Kim,Jaegyun Im,Byeongjoon Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Objectomaly是一种基于对象感知的OoD分割框架，通过三阶段方法优化边界精度和异常评分，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于掩码的OoD分割方法存在边界不精确、异常评分不一致和背景噪声导致的误报问题，需要改进。

Method: Objectomaly分为三个阶段：粗粒度异常评分（CAS）、对象感知评分校准（OASC）和精细边界优化（MBP）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，像素级和组件级指标均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过对象级先验和边界优化，实现了鲁棒且通用的OoD分割。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

*Chang-Hwan Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN的盲人脸图像恢复框架，通过局部统计特征变换和退化无关特征嵌入模块，显著提升了恶劣天气下的人脸识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的人脸图像质量下降，导致识别精度降低，现有方法缺乏针对性模块，无法有效解决天气引起的退化问题。

Method: 结合局部统计特征变换（SFFT）和退化无关特征嵌入（DAFE）模块，SFFT通过对齐低质量与高质量区域的局部统计分布增强结构，DAFE通过对齐编码表示实现鲁棒特征提取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抑制纹理失真和准确重建面部结构方面优于现有GAN和扩散模型方法。

Conclusion: SFFT和DAFE模块在恶劣天气下显著提升了人脸恢复的结构保真度和感知质量。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的生成框架TUEs，用于防止个人视频数据被未经授权用于深度跟踪器训练，解决了现有方法在视频任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的兴起，大量用户上传的视频被用于视觉目标跟踪（VOT）训练，但视频数据隐私问题被忽视，许多私人视频未经授权被用于商业模型训练。

Method: 提出了一种生成时间不可学习示例（TUEs）的框架，并引入时间对比损失，以增强TUEs的效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频数据隐私保护方面达到了最先进的性能，并具有强大的跨VOT模型、数据集和时间匹配任务的迁移性。

Conclusion: TUEs框架有效保护了视频数据隐私，解决了现有方法的局限性，为视频数据隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Result: DMPO在人类评估和自动指标上均优于现有方法，PickScore提升至少64.6%。

Conclusion: DMPO为扩散模型偏好对齐提供了高效且理论支持的新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

TL;DR: GGMotion提出了一种基于分组图动力学-运动学网络的方法，通过建模人体拓扑结构来更好地利用动力学和运动学先验，显著提升了运动预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人体姿态表示为抽象图结构，忽略了关节间的物理依赖关系，导致学习困难且易生成不真实的运动。

Method: 提出GGMotion，采用分组图网络建模人体拓扑，引入径向场捕获时空依赖，并通过组内和组间交互模块捕捉多尺度关节依赖。结合等变MLP和辅助损失提升物理合理性。

Result: 在Human3.6M、CMU-Mocap和3DPW三个基准测试中表现优异，短期运动预测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: GGMotion通过分组建模和物理先验的引入，有效提升了运动预测的准确性和物理合理性。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Conclusion: MUVOD数据集为动态场景的4D对象分割提供了基础资源，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

Conclusion: 该方法通过样条和低秩编码，解决了现有方法的局限性，在时空一致性和插值性能上表现优异。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

Result: 发现线性推理瓶颈普遍存在，且源于语言模型的推理路径问题；任务依赖的干预可以激活休眠推理路径。

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳健的推理需要针对性的对齐而非单纯改进表示学习，为VLM分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS通过结合DGKD和DGF2，有效解决了低光环境下的弱监督语义分割问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Result: 实验表明，RED在多个基准测试和LVLMs中显著优于标准CoT和其他解码方法。

Conclusion: RED是一种实用且有效的方法，能够提升LVLMs中CoT推理的准确性和可靠性，为多模态系统的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SpatialViz-Bench，一个多模态空间可视化基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在空间可视化任务中的表现，发现现有模型存在明显缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如IQ测试或数学竞赛）可能因与训练数据重叠而不可靠，且空间可视化能力未得到充分评估。

Method: 开发了包含12个任务、1,180个自动生成问题的SpatialViz-Bench基准测试，评估了33个先进的多模态大型语言模型。

Result: 模型表现差异大，存在反直觉行为（如感知困难与人类直觉不符、2D到3D性能骤降、过度依赖公式推导）。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench揭示了当前模型在空间可视化任务中的不足，填补了领域空白，并公开了基准测试。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确转移发型并实现视角间无缝一致，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2在多视角头发转移领域设定了新基准，代码已开源。

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决长视频推理中的独特挑战，提升视觉语言模型在长视频任务中的表现。

Method: 1. 构建大规模数据集LongVideo-Reason；2. 两阶段训练流程（CoT-SFT和RL）；3. 开发多模态强化序列并行（MR-SP）基础设施。

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B在长视频QA任务中表现优异，超越Video-R1-7B，匹配Gemini-1.5-Pro，MR-SP系统提速2.1倍。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1是VLM在长视频推理中的重要进展，并开源了支持多模态和多模型的训练系统。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

Result: 在LaSOT和LaSOText上取得SOTA性能，大模型AUC相对提升9.6%和7.2%，小模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的无训练、低开销改进显著提升了长期跟踪性能。

Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object
tracking task, addressing challenges such as occlusions, background clutter,
and target reappearance. We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation
strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear
refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.
In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and
short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term
occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent
improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model,
achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2,
and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the
effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting
long-term tracking performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有视觉推理模型缺乏全面评估基准，TreeBench填补了这一空白。

Method: 基于三项原则构建TreeBench，并开发TreeVGR方法，结合强化学习监督定位和推理。

Result: TreeBench包含405个挑战性问题，先进模型准确率不足60%。TreeVGR在多个基准上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 追踪证据是提升视觉推理的关键，TreeBench和TreeVGR为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在为实践者提供在数据集偏移下实现稳健校准的方法和见解。

Method: 比较了多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑），并在多个分类任务和图像领域中进行测试。

Result: 发现熵正则化和标签平滑结合效果最佳，后处理校准器在少量语义OOD数据下表现稳健，新校准方法未必优于简单方法，且校准改进常以牺牲分布内校准为代价。

Conclusion: 微调基础模型的分类器校准效果更好，集成方法结合微调能显著提升校准鲁棒性。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

Motivation: 解决图像语义标签在3D点云中噪声多且稀疏的问题。

Conclusion: LOSC是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了3D点云的开放词汇分割性能。

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

TL;DR: ViaPT提出了一种基于实例感知的视觉提示调整方法，通过结合数据集级和实例级提示，提升了视觉变换器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示调整方法使用固定数据集级提示，导致性能不佳，因为下游数据集差异大。

Method: ViaPT为每个输入生成实例感知提示，并与数据集级提示融合，利用PCA保留关键信息。

Result: 在34个数据集上的实验表明，ViaPT优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViaPT通过平衡数据集级和实例级知识，优化了视觉提示调整，减少了可学习参数。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Conclusion: ViLU在不确定性量化方面取得了显著进展，适用于大规模数据集，代码已公开。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

Motivation: 现有视频生成方法在超低码率下受限于领域特异性或对高层文本引导的依赖，导致运动细节丢失和不真实的重建。

Method: T-GVC采用语义感知的稀疏运动采样，提取像素级运动轨迹点，并结合轨迹对齐的损失约束，实现无训练的潜在空间引导。

Result: 实验表明，T-GVC在超低码率下优于传统编解码器和端到端压缩方法，且运动控制更精确。

Conclusion: T-GVC为基于几何运动建模的生成视频编码提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Motivation: FER模型在年龄上存在偏见，尤其是对老年人的识别性能较差，影响了公平性和可靠性。

Method: 研究分析了FER模型在不同年龄组的表现差异，使用XAI技术识别问题，并提出了多任务学习、多模态输入和年龄加权损失三种缓解策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的策略显著提高了对老年人的识别准确率，尤其是对易错表情的识别。

Conclusion: 通过简单的训练调整可以有效缓解FER中的年龄偏见，近似的人口统计标签对提升公平性也有价值。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Result: 在MitoDataset上，药物识别和MoA分类的mAP分别提升51.2%和20.5%。

Conclusion: MolCLIP通过多模态融合显著提升药物MoA分析的性能。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动作单元（AU）知识的动态面部表情识别架构AU-DFER，通过量化AU对表情的贡献并设计权重矩阵，显著提升了识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态面部表情识别研究多从深度学习角度进行特征学习，但缺乏对AU-expression知识的利用。

Method: 设计AU损失函数，将AU知识整合到深度学习网络中，并在主流数据集上验证。

Result: AU-DFER在无需额外计算的情况下优于现有方法，并解决了数据标签不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 量化AU知识可有效提升动态表情识别效果，数据标签不平衡问题需通过多样化损失函数设计解决。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Motivation: 实验室小鼠的高密度饲养、相似外观和高活动性导致个体识别困难，影响数据准确性和动物福利。

Method: 开发了包含多目标追踪器（MouseTracks）、基于Transformer的ID分类器（Mouseformer）和轨迹关联线性程序（MouseMap）的实时识别算法。

Result: 算法能以30帧/秒的速度准确识别小鼠，提升追踪效率并减少ID切换。

Conclusion: 该算法优于现有方法，适用于不同小鼠品系和环境条件。

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Result: 实验证明Tree-Mamba在质量和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba通过创新方法和可靠数据集显著提升了水下深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Geometry Forcing的方法，通过几何对齐目标改进视频扩散模型，使其学习更具几何感知的3D表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型仅基于原始视频数据训练，难以捕捉有意义的几何感知结构，因此需要一种方法弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出Geometry Forcing方法，通过Angular Alignment和Scale Alignment两个对齐目标，引导模型学习几何感知的3D表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和3D一致性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing有效提升了视频扩散模型的几何感知能力，为3D视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

TL;DR: 论文提出CrossVLAD基准数据集和CRAFT攻击方法，用于评估统一视觉语言模型在多任务对抗攻击中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多任务指令下的安全性问题，尤其是对抗输入在不同任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出CrossVLAD数据集和CRAFT攻击框架，通过区域中心化攻击和令牌对齐实现跨任务对抗攻击。

Result: CRAFT在Florence-2等模型上表现优于现有方法，跨任务攻击和目标对象改变成功率更高。

Conclusion: CRAFT能有效影响统一VLMs在多任务中的表现，为模型安全性评估提供新工具。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型（LLMs）因处理大量时空令牌导致计算复杂度呈二次增长，亟需一种高效的方法减少令牌数量而不显著影响性能。

Method: STTM通过多粒度空间令牌转换（基于四叉树结构）和定向时间维度合并，分解处理时空冗余。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中，STTM表现优于现有令牌缩减方法，例如在50%令牌预算下实现2倍加速且准确率仅下降0.5%。

Conclusion: STTM是一种高效、查询无关的令牌合并方法，适用于视频理解任务，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Motivation: 现有评估协议依赖粗粒度指标，掩盖了模型间的差异，缺乏神经科学基础，且无法捕捉细粒度视觉差异。

Method: 引入分层分割指标和多模态大语言模型提取结构化场景表示，进行细粒度评估。

Result: 在统一框架下对多种视觉解码方法进行基准测试，提供了更具区分性、可解释性和全面性的评估基础。

Conclusion: BASIC为脑视觉解码方法提供了更精细、可解释和全面的评估标准。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习系统通常使用固定长度的表示，忽略了输入数据的复杂性或熟悉度变化。KARL旨在通过自适应分词解决这一问题。

Method: KARL采用单次前向传递预测分词数量，训练过程类似于倒置强化学习，基于重建质量条件预测分词停止。

Result: KARL在单次操作中性能与现有自适应分词器相当，并提供了关于编码器/解码器大小、连续与离散分词等的扩展规律分析。

Conclusion: KARL展示了自适应图像分词与算法信息理论的类比，其预测的图像复杂度与人类直觉一致。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Result: 该方法减少了推理时间，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简化了3D分割流程，提升了效率和实用性。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能显著减少模型偏见并提升性能，适用于多种视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Conclusion: 该方法在早期事件识别和实际任务（如运动捕捉）中表现出显著潜力。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖预训练模型的最终层特征，限制了其在新领域的适应性。参数高效微调（如侧调谐）虽有效，但忽视了MR的稀疏性。

Method: 提出了SDST，首个无锚点的侧调谐架构，并结合参考型可变形自注意力机制，优化了上下文建模。同时首次将InternVideo2主干网络集成到侧调谐框架中。

Conclusion: SDST显著提升了现有侧调谐方法的性能，同时大幅减少了参数数量，为视频时间定位任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter

quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的体素级变形估计方法，用于解决增材制造中CAD与XCT体积数据的精确配准问题，显著提升了配准精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增材制造中的几何不准确性会影响部件性能，传统数字体积相关方法因缺乏地面真实数据和计算量大而难以精确配准。

Method: 采用动态分块处理策略的深度学习模型，引入二进制差异图（BDM）评估配准精度。

Result: 相比传统方法，Dice分数提升了9.2%，体素匹配率提高了9.9%，交互时间从几天缩短至几分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于深度学习的DVC技术奠定了基础，有望提高增材制造的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

TL;DR: SCOOTER是一个开源框架，用于评估无限制对抗攻击的不可感知性，提供统计支持的工具和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御策略无法应对无限制对抗攻击，且缺乏统计显著的人类评估方法。

Method: 提出SCOOTER框架，包括众包研究指南、大规模人类与模型对比、开源工具和基准数据集。

Result: 研究发现现有攻击方法无法生成不可感知的图像，且GPT-4o检测效果有限。

Conclusion: SCOOTER框架填补了评估无限制对抗攻击的空白，强调人类感知与自动化系统的不一致。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Motivation: 当前3D视觉语言研究中空间推理能力未被充分探索，现有数据集存在模型依赖表面捷径而非真正理解空间关系的问题。

Method: 提出S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，包含200k+视觉语言对和89k+人工标注的空间查询，避免使用对象名称以减少偏见。

Result: 初步测试显示当前最先进的3D视觉定位方法和3D-LLMs面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D和3D-SRS基准套件有助于推动空间感知AI的发展，促进有效的具身交互和机器人规划。

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

Conclusion: 所提方法在复杂场景下具有更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为rPPG技术提供了有效改进。

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 现实应用中多模态数据常存在缺失或不完整，导致性能下降，现有静态提示方法缺乏灵活性且难以应对关键模态缺失。

Method: 引入动态适配器生成自适应提示，结合静态和动态提示的协同策略，平衡多模态信息。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的视觉识别数据集上表现优于现有方法，适应性强且可靠。

Conclusion: SyP框架有效解决了多模态缺失问题，具有显著的性能提升和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次将Vision Transformers（ViT）应用于无标记肺肿瘤运动预测，比较了患者特定（PS）和多患者（MP）训练策略的效果。PS模型在精度上更优，而MP模型在无需重新训练的情况下表现出更强的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无标记方法主要依赖深度学习，而基于Transformer的架构在此领域尚未探索，尽管其在轨迹预测中表现优异。

Method: 使用31名患者的4DCT扫描生成的DRR训练MP模型，PS模型仅使用目标患者的规划数据。两种模型均预测1秒内的肿瘤运动，并通过ADE和FDE评估性能。

Result: PS模型在规划数据上表现更优，但MP模型在治疗数据上表现出更强的鲁棒性，且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: ViT架构首次应用于无标记肿瘤运动预测，PS模型精度高，MP模型适合时间紧迫的临床环境。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Motivation: 解决现有解耦框架在类增量图像分割中存在的可塑性丧失和对输入数据顺序的过度依赖问题。

Method: 直接选择图像特征进行查询分配，确保“完美对齐”以保留对象性，同时引入跨阶段一致性选择和基于“视觉查询”的重放机制。

Result: SimCIS在多种分割任务、设置、分割和输入数据顺序下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SimCIS是一种简单但强大的基线方法，有效解决了类增量图像分割中的关键问题。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM为开发鲁棒的3D异常检测模型提供了基准，有望推动现代制造环境的需求满足。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Conclusion: THUNDER为数字病理学领域提供了高效的模型评估工具，促进研究透明性和可靠性。

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Motivation: 现有基于像素域扩散的图像恢复方法在复杂几何和深度变化场景中计算量大且易产生不真实伪影，需改进。

Method: 结合预训练潜在扩散模型和显式场景分解（SLURPP），并设计基于物理的水下图像合成流水线生成多样化训练数据。

Result: SLURPP比现有扩散方法快200倍，合成基准测试PSNR提升约3 dB，在真实数据上也有显著质量改进。

Conclusion: SLURPP在计算效率和恢复质量上均优于现有方法，适用于复杂水下场景。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Result: 在公开医学VQA和报告生成基准测试中，MIRA显著提升事实准确性和性能，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MIRA通过优化检索和知识整合，有效提升多模态大语言模型在医学诊断中的事实准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource-constrained wearable devices
demands inference models that harmonize accuracy with computational efficiency.
This paper introduces TinierHAR, an ultra-lightweight deep learning
architecture that synergizes residual depthwise separable convolutions, gated
recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal aggregation to achieve SOTA efficiency
without compromising performance. Evaluated across 14 public HAR datasets,
TinierHAR reduces Parameters by 2.7x (vs. TinyHAR) and 43.3x (vs.
DeepConvLSTM), and MACs by 6.4x and 58.6x, respectively, while maintaining the
averaged F1-scores. Beyond quantitative gains, this work provides the first
systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal
components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical
DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems.
We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines
for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all
materials in this work for future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为任务演练和机器人模拟提供逼真的火星景观视频，但火星数据稀缺且与地球图像差异大。

Method: 1) 数据重建管道M3arsSynth，从NASA立体导航图像重建3D环境；2) 视频生成器MarsGen，基于3D结构合成视频。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效生成逼真且几何一致的火星视频，适用于任务模拟。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估离线场景下的模型性能，而真实世界的感知任务需要模型具备在线处理和时空推理能力。

Method: 通过高效的数据收集流程构建了包含1.4k场景和10k问答对的OST-Bench数据集，并评估了多个领先MLLMs的性能。

Result: MLLMs在复杂时空推理任务上表现不佳，随着探索时间和记忆增长，准确性下降。

Conclusion: OST-Bench揭示了MLLMs在在线时空推理中的核心挑战，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型在视觉-语言对比学习中的局限性，特别是其无法区分图像中物体属性绑定的问题。通过分析数据属性对模型性能的影响，发现自然数据的低属性密度、不完整标注和显著性偏差是主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在视觉-语言任务中表现优异，但其表示能力存在局限性，尤其是在物体属性绑定方面。作者希望通过研究数据属性对模型性能的影响，解决这一问题。

Method: 使用合成数据集，系统分析数据属性（如属性密度、标注完整性、显著性偏差）对CLIP模型学习绑定的影响。

Result: 研究发现，自然数据的低属性密度、不完整标注和显著性偏差显著降低了CLIP的绑定性能。增加批量大小或显式生成困难负样本均无效，只有在数据满足特定属性时，CLIP才能学习到近乎完美的绑定。

Conclusion: 数据属性是影响CLIP模型学习绑定的关键因素。未来的工作应关注如何改进数据设计以提升模型性能。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了草图驱动的少样本关键点检测问题。

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

Motivation: 现有VQ-VAEs在重建质量上与VAEs存在较大差距，需改进量化策略以缩小这一差距。

Result: 在ImageNet和8个零样本基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于SD-VAE。

Conclusion: \NickName在重建任务中表现出色，为高清图像处理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD

Motivation: 探讨训练数据中概念组合对CLIP/LMM性能的影响，尤其是常见物体在罕见配对中的表现。

Method: 使用点互信息（PMI）衡量词共现频率，通过合成和编辑自然图像验证PMI与模型准确性的相关性。

Result: PMI与CLIP零样本准确性强相关（r=0.97），且在自然图像中重现（r=0.75），LMMs也表现出类似行为。

Conclusion: 需改进算法和架构以提升多模态模型的组合泛化能力，避免训练数据的组合爆炸。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）的认知偏见主要源于预训练阶段，而非微调或训练随机性。通过多轮微调和跨调实验，揭示了预训练对偏见模式的决定性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs中认知偏见的来源，区分预训练、微调和训练随机性的影响，以指导未来偏见评估和缓解策略。

Method: 采用两步因果实验：1）多次微调不同随机种子的模型；2）引入跨调方法，交换指令数据集以隔离偏见来源。

Result: 训练随机性带来一定变异性，但偏见模式主要由预训练决定：相同预训练主干的模型表现出更相似的偏见模式。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏见需考虑预训练起源，这为未来评估和缓解LLMs偏见提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs作为社会科学调查代理的可靠性和对已知响应偏差的易感性。

Method: 测试九种不同的LLMs，应用11种扰动（问题表述和答案选项结构），模拟超过167,000次访谈。

Result: 所有模型均表现出近因偏差，较大模型更鲁棒，但对语义变化和组合扰动仍敏感。

Conclusion: 提示设计和鲁棒性测试在LLMs生成合成调查数据中至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SynthEHR-Eviction，结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化，从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，构建最大公开SDoH数据集，性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是健康的社会决定因素（SDoH）之一，但研究不足，且电子健康记录（EHRs）中缺乏结构化数据。

Method: 结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化（APO），构建SynthEHR-Eviction流程，提取临床记录中的驱逐状态。

Result: 构建了最大的公开SDoH数据集（14类），微调LLMs性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT，Macro-F1达88.8%（驱逐）和90.3%（其他SDoH）。

Conclusion: SynthEHR-Eviction显著减少标注工作量（80%以上），加速数据集构建，适用于其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: 研究表明，将时间序列理解压缩到轻量级语言模型中是可行的，为开发小型可解释模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

TL;DR: 论文提出SAND框架，通过自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作评估，帮助LLM代理在行动前明确考虑候选动作，从而改善其决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调或偏好优化）可能导致LLM代理过度依赖看似合理但次优的动作，缺乏对替代动作的探索。

Method: 提出SAND框架，结合自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作评估，生成逐步的动作思考轨迹，并用于微调LLM代理。

Result: 在两个交互式代理任务中，SAND比初始监督微调平均提升20%，并优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: SAND通过动作审议显著提升了LLM代理的决策能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在强化学习中训练不稳定和策略漂移的问题。

Method: RLEP分为两阶段：收集已验证轨迹，并在训练中重放这些轨迹，混合新生成的数据进行优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，如AIME-2024准确率从38.2%提升至39.9%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量轨迹，实现了更快的收敛和更强的最终性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

Motivation: 研究LLM中真实性丧失的广泛现象，提供统一框架和分析工具。

Method: 提出废话指数和四种废话分类法，并在多个数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: RLHF和CoT提示显著增加废话行为，政治语境中废话尤为普遍。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，为提升LLM真实性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING是一种后训练框架，通过从大型语言模型提取任务分解（规划轨迹）并微调小型模型，显著提升了复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用任务分解提升小型开源语言模型的性能，填补了后训练阶段规划结构应用的空白。

Method: 通过监督和强化学习目标，模仿大型模型的规划过程，微调小型模型。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准上平均提升7%，在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024上分别提升10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING是提升小型语言模型任务特定性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLM的推理能力是研究重点，现有方法依赖复杂代码结构导致过拟合，需改进。

Method: TeaR结合数据筛选和强化学习，指导模型在代码任务中发现最优推理路径。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TeaR显著提升性能，如Qwen2.5-7B提升35.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效提升LLM推理能力，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高燃料电池效率的关键在于ORR催化剂，但科学文献中复杂多样的文本数据使得结构化信息提取成为挑战。

Method: 采用DyGIE++结合多种预训练BERT变体（如MatSciBERT和PubMedBERT），通过数据标注、模型微调等方法提取ORR催化剂信息。

Result: PubMedBERT在NER任务中F1-score达82.19%，MatSciBERT在RE任务中F1-score为66.10%，领域特定BERT模型优于通用科学模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定BERT模型在ORR催化剂信息提取中表现优异，展示了自动化文献分析的潜力。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Result: LLM无法完成或验证超出特定复杂度的计算和代理任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM的能力边界，对实际应用中的任务设计具有指导意义。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Result: CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上的策略预测和情感支持对话任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据稀缺问题，并提供了高质量的心理支持对话系统。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Conclusion: VAP可用于三人对话的轮流发言预测，未来将整合到语音对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在少样本提示下的表现，尤其是在噪声或低质量数据环境中，是否能够超越传统微调的小语言模型（SLMs）。

Method: 使用精心设计的少样本提示，结合LLMs，并尝试了辩论式提示和多种示例选择策略。

Result: 在CheckThat! 2025任务中，系统在多个语言中排名靠前，尤其是阿拉伯语和波兰语中排名第一。

Conclusion: LLM-based少样本学习在多语言情感任务中高效且适应性强，特别适用于标注数据稀缺或不一致的情况。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Method: 使用真实企业数据集构建基准，系统研究多语言检索行为，并提出一种强制均衡检索的策略。

Result: 检索在多语言场景中表现不佳，尤其是查询与文档语言不同时；提出的策略显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 改进多语言检索对实际RAG应用具有重要意义，未来研究应关注这一方向。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 探索长链思维SFT和RL在多模态推理任务中的联合有效性及其潜在协同作用。

Method: 通过系统实验分析长链思维SFT和RL在不同难度任务中的表现，并尝试多种结合策略（如分阶段训练、数据混合等）。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题的推理能力但降低简单问题性能；RL提高泛化性和简洁性，但两者结合未能实现叠加效果。

Conclusion: 需开发更自适应的方法以充分发挥联合后训练技术在VLM推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Motivation: 解决文档图像机器翻译中因训练数据有限和视觉-文本信息复杂交互导致的泛化问题。

Method: 提出M4Doc框架，通过将单模态编码器与多模态大语言模型对齐，学习视觉-文本关联。

Result: 实验表明M4Doc显著提升翻译质量，尤其在跨域泛化和复杂文档图像场景中。

Conclusion: M4Doc通过轻量化设计高效利用多模态知识，为文档图像翻译提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示离散扩散语言模型的贝叶斯核心，探索其理论一致性及实际应用潜力。

Method: 通过蒙特卡罗边缘化方法，利用K次独立损坏的平均值逼近后验分布，提出推理时集成方法。

Result: 在WikiText-2上，测试困惑度为8.8（K=8），优于GPT-2 Small的20.3。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实际性能上均表现出色，无需额外训练成本即可提升模型表现。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过知识蒸馏（KD）压缩大型语言模型（LLMs）以保持问答（QA）任务性能的方法，结果表明学生模型在参数减少57.1%的情况下仍能保留90%以上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在NLP任务中表现优异，但计算需求高，限制了其在资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏从Pythia和Qwen2.5家族中提取学生模型，并在SQuAD和MLQA两个QA基准上评估零样本和单样本提示条件下的性能。

Result: 学生模型在参数减少57.1%的情况下仍能保留90%以上的性能，单样本提示比零样本提示表现更好。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示可以在模型效率和任务性能之间取得平衡，适用于资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进检索增强生成（RAG）效率的方法，通过优化提示和少量训练数据，减少检索次数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法主要关注准确性和召回率，而忽略了检索效率的重要性。本文旨在证明无需大规模微调即可提升RAG性能，并减少检索次数。

Method: 采用标准ReAct流程优化提示，结合监督和基于强化学习的微调，以减少检索次数。

Result: 在HotPotQA等基准测试中，优化后的方法性能优于现有技术，且检索次数减少近一半。

Conclusion: 优化提示和少量训练数据可显著提升RAG效率，减少检索成本，同时保持竞争力。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对中文内容审核中语音伪装替换（PCR）问题的研究，包括分类、数据集构建、模型评估及改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音伪装替换（PCR）已成为中文内容审核的主要障碍，现有方法依赖规则生成的合成数据，忽视了真实用户的创造性。

Method: 构建了一个包含500个自然发生的PCR帖子的数据集，并评估了现有大语言模型的性能，提出了一种基于拼音的提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.672，零样本思维链提示效果更差，但拼音提示策略显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分类了中文PCR，揭示了当前检测器的局限性，并提出了一种轻量级改进方法。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摘要评估依赖人工参考摘要，耗时且不高效，NOIR旨在提供自动化评估工具。

Method: 利用语言模型嵌入测量语义相似性，结合摘要长度压缩，量化摘要质量。

Result: NOIR能有效捕捉语义保留与压缩的权衡，并与人类感知的摘要质量相关。

Conclusion: NOIR为摘要任务提供自动化评估工具，可优化摘要算法和生成过程。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Simulated Attention Score (SAS)的方法，通过模拟更多注意力头和更大的隐藏特征维度来提升模型性能，同时保持参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到多头注意力（MHA）的性能随注意力头数量增加而提升，但需保证每头的隐藏尺寸足够大。因此，如何在增加头和隐藏尺寸的同时最小化参数开销成为研究动机。

Method: 提出SAS方法，通过将低维头表示投影到高维空间，模拟更多头和更大的隐藏特征维度，同时引入Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA)控制参数成本。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务上的实验表明，SAS方法显著优于其他注意力变体，性能提升明显。

Conclusion: SAS方法在保持模型紧凑的同时，通过模拟更大模型的行为显著提升了性能，是一种高效的注意力机制改进方案。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Motivation: 解决传统微调方法在大型语言模型（LLMs）知识扩展中的高资源消耗问题，以及朴素RAG实现的可扩展性和答案准确性不足。

Method: 提出K2RAG框架，整合密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要，并引入预处理步骤以缩短训练时间。

Result: 在MultiHopRAG数据集上，K2RAG实现了0.57的平均答案相似度得分和0.82的Q3相似度，训练时间减少93%，执行速度提升40%，且VRAM需求减少三倍。

Conclusion: K2RAG在准确性、效率和可扩展性方面均优于传统RAG实现，为LLMs的知识扩展提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

TL;DR: 论文验证了Vec2Text框架能从嵌入向量重建原始文本，并探讨了隐私防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为传输嵌入向量比原始文本更隐私，但Vec2Text挑战了这一假设，因此需要进一步验证其效果和隐私风险。

Method: 复制Vec2Text框架，验证其原始结果，并通过参数敏感性分析、敏感输入重建实验和嵌入量化防御扩展研究。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下能有效重建文本，包括无明确语义的密码类序列，但对输入长度敏感；高斯噪声和量化技术可缓解隐私风险。

Conclusion: 使用文本嵌入需谨慎，需进一步研究NLP系统的鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的后训练对齐是一个关键挑战，因为并非所有标记对模型性能的贡献均等。

Method: 利用当前策略与参考模型之间的标记级对数概率差异，优先选择高影响力标记进行对齐。

Result: 在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中，Selective-DPO方法优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: 标记级优化和参考模型选择对提升LLM偏好对齐效果至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Result: 实验显示StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一模型和CoT方法，高效解决了流式语音翻译的挑战。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将符号知识整合到数据驱动的学习算法中，需要语义一致的连续逻辑公式表示，并且这些表示必须可逆以生成具体需求。

Method: 通过训练一个仅解码器的Transformer模型，反转STL公式的语义嵌入，并使用小词汇表生成有效公式。

Result: 模型在1个epoch后即可生成有效公式，约10个epoch后能泛化到逻辑语义，并能生成更简洁且语义接近的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在需求挖掘任务中有效，可直接在语义空间中进行优化。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our

*Gianluca Vico,Jindřinch Libovický*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件单字分词的新方法，通过源语言标记调整目标标记概率，以优化跨语言语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进单字分词方法，通过利用平行数据中的源语言标记信息，提升跨语言语义对齐能力。

Method: 固定源分词器，学习目标分词器，最大化跨语言语义对齐。

Result: 在机器翻译中无改进，但在语言建模中困惑度降低。

Conclusion: 条件概率估计的二次扩展可能导致数据效率瓶颈，需探索其他参数化方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

*Youngjoon Jang,Seongtae Hong,Junyoung Son,Sungjin Park,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了检索增强生成（RAG）中实体共指对检索和生成性能的影响，发现共指消解能提升检索效果和问答性能，且小模型受益更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG框架在NLP中虽重要，但共指复杂性会引入歧义，影响性能。本研究旨在系统分析共指对RAG的影响。

Method: 通过比较不同池化策略和共指消解，分析其对检索和问答任务的影响。

Result: 共指消解提升检索效果；均值池化在共指消解后表现最佳；小模型在消歧过程中受益更多。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了共指复杂性对RAG的挑战，为知识密集型AI应用的改进提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

TL;DR: 论文将Alpay代数扩展为多层语义游戏架构，通过嵌套博弈结构实现AI系统与文档的对齐，证明了语义均衡的存在性与唯一性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是将Alpay代数的自指框架扩展为多层语义游戏架构，以解决AI系统与文档对齐的复杂性问题。

Method: 方法包括引入复合算子ϕ(·, γ(·))，其中ϕ驱动主语义收敛，γ解决局部子博弈，并应用Banach不动点定理和Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann公式。

Result: 结果证明了语义均衡的存在性与唯一性，并通过验证套件展示了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 结论是博弈论推理自然地从不动点迭代中涌现，框架在AI嵌入空间中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

### [135] [DocCHA: Towards LLM-Augmented Interactive Online diagnosis System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07870)
*Xinyi Liu,Dachun Sun,Yi R. Fung,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Tarek Abdelzaher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocCHA是一个模块化框架，通过分阶段临床推理提升对话式健康代理的诊断能力，显著优于现有LLM基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话式健康代理（CHAs）缺乏适应性和透明性，限制了其在临床诊断中的应用。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分为三个阶段：症状提取、病史获取和因果图构建，每个阶段使用可解释的置信度分数。

Result: 在两个中文咨询数据集上，DocCHA诊断准确率提高5.18%，症状召回率提升30%，对话轮次增加较少。

Conclusion: DocCHA展示了结构化、透明且高效的诊断对话潜力，适用于多语言和资源受限环境。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

*Achuth Chandrasekhar,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（Gemini 2.0 Flash）和自动化工具（Python脚本、Selenium）开发了一个自动化流程，用于高效生成分子动力学模拟输入文件，减少人工错误并节省时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分子动力学模拟输入文件准备过程耗时且易出错，亟需自动化解决方案以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 结合Gemini 2.0 Flash的代码生成能力、Python脚本和Selenium自动化工具，利用CHARMM GUI生成NAMD输入文件，并通过后处理软件优化输出。

Result: 该方法显著减少了输入文件准备时间，降低了人工错误，并能并行处理多个蛋白质系统。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中大型语言模型的广泛应用提供了基础，未来可进一步优化模拟自动化技术。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Motivation: 解决现有动态主题建模技术缺乏统一流程和用户友好探索的问题。

Method: 开发DTECT系统，支持数据预处理、多模型架构、评估指标，并引入LLM驱动的自动主题标注、趋势分析和交互式可视化。

Result: DTECT显著提升了主题建模的解读性和用户交互体验。

Conclusion: DTECT为动态主题建模提供了一个高效、易用的统一平台，支持开源使用。

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end
system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal
insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,
multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at

*Guoxin Zang,Xue Li,Donglin Di,Lanshun Nie,Dechen Zhan,Yang Song,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的框架，通过自引导事实增强（SFE）和熵感知直接偏好优化（E-DPO）提升工业异常检测的推理能力，并引入AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在工业异常检测中表现不佳，缺乏可解释性和泛化能力，SAGE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAGE结合SFE和E-DPO，利用AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架优化模型推理能力。

Result: SAGE在零样本和单样本设置下表现出色。

Conclusion: SAGE为工业异常检测提供了更精确、结构化和上下文感知的解决方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

TL;DR: MIRIX是一种模块化多代理记忆系统，通过六种结构化记忆类型和多代理框架，解决了AI记忆的关键挑战，在视觉和多模态任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI记忆解决方案功能有限，无法实现个性化、抽象化和可靠记忆，MIRIX旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MIRIX包含六种记忆类型（核心、情景、语义、程序、资源记忆和知识库），结合多代理框架动态管理记忆更新与检索。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA和LOCOMO基准测试中，MIRIX分别比基线高35%和达到85.4%的准确率，存储需求降低99.9%。

Conclusion: MIRIX为记忆增强型LLM代理设定了新标准，并提供了实际应用支持。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）比显式奖励模型（EX-RM）泛化能力差，主要原因是IM-RM更依赖表面标记级线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）和显式奖励模型（EX-RM）泛化能力差异的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RM和EX-RM的泛化行为，验证其依赖的线索类型。

Result: IM-RM更依赖表面标记级线索，导致其在标记级分布偏移和分布内泛化能力较差。

Conclusion: 设计选择对奖励模型的泛化行为有显著影响，IM-RM的局限性源于其依赖的线索类型。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Motivation: 探索如何在资源有限的医疗环境中利用语言模型支持临床决策，尤其是风湿病学领域。

Method: 使用小型语言模型（SLMs）结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，并与大型语言模型（LLMs）进行对比。

Result: SLMs+RAG在诊断和治疗性能上优于LLMs，且能耗更低，适合本地部署。

Conclusion: 尽管SLMs+RAG表现优异，但仍需专家监督，因其尚未达到风湿病学专家的准确度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为LLM医学推理评估提供基础工具，推动其在临床实践中的安全应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Result: PyVision显著提升性能（GPT-4.1 +7.8%，Claude-4.0-Sonnet +31.1%）。

Conclusion: 动态工具生成使模型不仅能使用工具，还能发明工具，推动更具自主性的视觉推理。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化学过程复杂性增加，劳动力短缺和故障场景复杂，需要新的自动化范式。

Method: 采用有限状态机（FSMs）作为可解释的操作框架，通过LLM驱动的规划代理、模拟代理和验证-重提循环实现。

Result: 在案例研究中，GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在180个随机生成的FSMs中实现100%有效路径成功率，并在双加热器控制中表现与PID控制相当。

Conclusion: 通过结构化反馈和模块化代理，LLMs可以统一高层符号规划和低层连续控制，为化学工程中的语言驱动自动化铺平道路。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在艺术分类中存在偏见问题，尤其是当训练数据分布不均衡时，模型对罕见艺术风格的分类准确性下降。现有研究忽视了这一偏见问题，尤其是在处理分布外数据时。

Method: 提出BOOST方法，通过动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，优化模型对各类别的公平表示。同时，设计了新指标SODC用于评估类别分离和偏见减少效果。

Result: 在KaoKore和PACS数据集上，BOOST方法在保持高性能的同时显著减少了类别偏见。

Conclusion: BOOST方法为艺术领域的AI模型去偏见提供了有效解决方案，平衡了性能与公平性。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Motivation: 大语言模型在动态游戏交互中表现良好，但在规则驱动的交易系统中容易出现违规行为（如物品幻觉和计算错误），影响玩家信任。

Method: 提出状态推断提示（SIBP），将交易分解为六个状态，通过上下文感知的物品引用和占位符价格计算实现规则遵守。

Result: 在100次交易对话中，状态合规率>97%，引用准确率>95%，计算精度达99.7%，计算效率优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SIBP为商业游戏中可信的NPC交互提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable
trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule
adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified
prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and
placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%
calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while
outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for

*Zili Wang,Frank Montabon,Kristin Yvonne Rozier*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用神经符号方法在数据稀疏且不可靠的供应链中检测非法活动，并比较了人工与自动特征提取的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链中的非法活动（如假冒零件、强迫劳动）数据稀疏且不可靠，传统机器学习方法难以应对，需要新的方法。

Method: 采用神经符号方法，结合大型语言模型（LLM）的问题树方法，对新闻文章进行自动分类和相关性评估。

Result: 比较了人工和机器分类新闻文章的效果，提出了系统化的评估方法。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法和LLM的问题树方法在稀疏数据下有效，为供应链非法活动检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

TL;DR: ViDove是一种基于多模态输入的翻译代理系统，通过结合视觉和上下文背景信息提升翻译质量，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译代理通常仅支持文本输入，缺乏多模态信息的利用，限制了翻译质量。

Method: ViDove模拟人类翻译流程，整合多模态记忆系统和长短时记忆模块，结合领域知识提升翻译适应性。

Result: 在字幕生成和通用翻译任务中，ViDove的BLEU分数提升28%，SubER提升15%。

Conclusion: ViDove在多模态翻译任务中表现优异，并推出了新的长视频字幕翻译基准DoveBench。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，防止其生成有害内容成为重要问题，研究旨在探索过滤方法的有效性。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究输入提示和输出内容的过滤效率，并基于密码学假设证明其计算难度。

Result: 发现不存在高效的输入提示过滤器，且输出过滤在特定情况下计算不可行。

Conclusion: 安全性需依赖LLM内部设计，而非外部过滤器，智能与判断不可分割。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Method: Sim-to-Dec框架包括生成模拟模块（利用自回归建模）和双感知决策模型（历史与未来信息结合），通过端到端优化迭代优化。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Sim-to-Dec显著提高了及时交付率和利润。

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec框架满足通用性、细粒度动态模拟、历史与预测结合以及模拟反馈与策略优化的紧密集成需求。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在科学领域（如药物发现）中推理能力受限的问题，传统方法如微调或检索增强生成存在计算开销大或未能充分利用结构化数据的局限性。

Method: 提出DrugMCTS框架，整合检索增强生成（RAG）、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索，通过五个专用智能体检索和分析分子与蛋白质信息，实现结构化迭代推理。

Result: 在DrugBank和KIBA数据集上，DrugMCTS显著优于通用LLM和深度学习基线，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct性能提升超过20%，召回率和鲁棒性更高。

Conclusion: 结构化推理、智能体协作和反馈驱动搜索机制对推进LLM在药物发现中的应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少同时评估生产活动和社会互动能力，因此需要一种综合评估工具。

Method: StarDojo包含1000个任务，分为五个领域，并提供100个代表性任务的子集。它提供统一接口，支持多环境并行执行。

Result: 现有最先进的MLLM代理表现有限，GPT-4.1的成功率仅为12.7%，主要因视觉理解、多模态推理和低层操作困难。

Conclusion: StarDojo旨在促进复杂生产生活环境中稳健开放式代理的研究。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

Conclusion: 系统评估LLM算法有助于理解其内部计算，推动高效训练和新架构设计。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Result: 研究发现常用工具学习的规则集存在负面问题。

Conclusion: 规则模型在高风险应用中需谨慎使用，需改进工具以减少负面影响。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Conclusion: Context Pooling是一种通用且高效的方法，显著提升了知识图谱链接预测的性能。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Result: 实验显示，LLMs在浅层查询中表现尚可，但在物理约束模拟、空间一致性保持及布局扰动泛化上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了LLMs在真实世界布局推理上的盲区，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标的设计提供了新思路，提升了语言模型对齐的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

TL;DR: FAI Benchmark评估AI对人类繁荣的贡献，涵盖七个维度，发现现有模型在部分维度表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估仅关注技术能力或避免危害，而FAI Benchmark旨在衡量AI对人类整体幸福的贡献。

Method: 通过1,229个主客观问题，结合专业LLM和几何平均评分，评估28个领先语言模型。

Result: 最高分模型得72/100，但所有模型在信仰与灵性、品格与美德、意义与目的等维度表现不足。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark为开发支持人类繁荣的AI提供了框架，对AI伦理和评估有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家模型（MoE）需要大量训练数据和复杂优化，而人类驾驶员的学习过程更高效。受此启发，研究旨在开发一种更高效的MoE模型。

Method: 提出技能导向的路由机制和分层技能数据集，模仿人类驾驶员的技能学习和多步推理过程，通过单次前向过程整合辅助任务。

Result: 模型在CODA AD任务中表现优于更大的模型，激活参数量减少至少62.5%，且性能达到最优。

Conclusion: MoSE通过模仿人类学习过程，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的效率和性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

TL;DR: 论文提出自适应感知作为AI发展的新范式，通过动态调整传感器参数提高效率，减少对大规模模型和数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI依赖大规模模型和数据集，带来环境、经济和伦理成本，限制了可持续性和公平性。生物感官系统的动态适应性提供了灵感。

Method: 提出自适应感知，动态调整传感器参数（如曝光、灵敏度、多模态配置），以应对协变量偏移并提升效率。

Result: 研究表明，自适应感知能让小型模型（如EfficientNet-B0）超越更大规模的模型（如OpenCLIP-H）。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁将自适应感知整合到实际应用中，提出研究方向以推动可持续、鲁棒和公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Conclusion: 该算法为解决实际原因识别问题提供了实用且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Result: 计算规模收益递减显著，预算有限模型性能接近最佳模型。

Conclusion: AI战略和政策需重新审视，以适应性能趋同趋势。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Conclusion: 研究结果为科学家选择数据存储和分析策略提供了依据。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

Conclusion: GridTD是一种高效、先进的压缩成像重建方法。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架为ccRCC复发预测提供了更全面的解决方案，有望改善临床决策。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.
