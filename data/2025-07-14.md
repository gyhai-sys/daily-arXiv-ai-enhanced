<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角技能评估问题，探索场景条件建模的有效性。

Method: 1. 多任务学习框架（Sapiens-2B）；2. 两阶段流程（零样本场景识别+VideoMAE分类器）。

Result: 两阶段方法准确率47.8%，优于多任务学习的43.6%。

Conclusion: 场景条件建模对技能评估有效，两阶段方法更优。

Abstract: This report presents the CuriosAI team's submission to the EgoExo4D
Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for
multi-view skill assessment: (1) a multi-task learning framework using
Sapiens-2B that jointly predicts proficiency and scenario labels (43.6 %
accuracy), and (2) a two-stage pipeline combining zero-shot scenario
recognition with view-specific VideoMAE classifiers (47.8 % accuracy). The
superior performance of the two-stage approach demonstrates the effectiveness
of scenario-conditioned modeling for proficiency estimation.

### [2] [Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Precision Agriculture: Multi-Response Consensus for Crop Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08024)
*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家评估与自一致性机制的农业图像处理框架，显著提升了玉米叶病识别的准确性和治疗建议效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需要更可靠的图像分析方法支持精准农业。

Method: 结合基于提示的专家评估协议和余弦一致性自投票机制，优化模型输出。

Result: 玉米叶病识别准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析和治疗建议也有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中具有实际应用潜力，支持实时农业决策。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并通过实验揭示了模型在生成简单图像时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM和文本到图像模型的研究相对较少，其可靠性和性能评估不足，因此需要建立一个全面的评估框架。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，利用GPT-4生成文本描述作为基准，通过文本到图像模型生成图像，再用GPT-4比较描述差异。

Result: 实验表明，模型在生成仅含两个变化因素的简单二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据分布。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在简单任务中表现有限，需进一步改进其提示遵循能力。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能。该方法通过预训练权重和微调激活向量直接估计LoRA权重，无需训练初始化，并在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了微调的性能和收敛速度。本文旨在通过数据驱动的初始化方法解决这一问题。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域偏移问题，利用预训练和微调激活之间的约束条件，推导出闭式解来初始化LoRA权重，并支持可变秩。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解等任务中，CNTLoRA在定量和定性上均优于标准及数据驱动的初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了一种无需训练初始化的高效方法，显著提升了LoRA微调的性能和收敛速度，并通过分析验证了其设计合理性。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间二型模糊逻辑的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层极限学习机（ML-ELM）及其变体在自然信号分类中表现良好，但需要进一步提升效率和分类性能。

Method: HML-ELM采用两阶段框架：1）基于ELM-AE的无监督特征提取；2）基于SIT2-FELM的监督分类。

Result: 实验表明，HML-ELM在图像分类和无人机任务中优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效且性能优越的分类方法，适用于无人机图像分类任务。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声（如均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯噪声）的效果，而非修改算法以适应噪声类型。实验在小型设备上进行，验证了算法在非理想噪声条件下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型在非高斯噪声条件下的表现，验证其鲁棒性，尤其是在资源有限的环境下。

Method: 使用原始算法，但将高斯噪声替换为其他类型（如均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯噪声），并在小型设备上进行实验。

Result: 实验展示了算法在非高斯噪声条件下的表现，为算法在不同噪声环境下的适用性提供了初步验证。

Conclusion: 论文提出了在非高斯噪声条件下使用扩散模型的可行性，并指出进一步研究在不同设备和图像规模下的表现是一个有趣的挑战。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的单幅VHR SAR图像建筑物高度自动估算方法，通过边界框检测和高度回归实现，并在多大陆数据集上验证了其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确估算建筑物高度对城市应用至关重要，但现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力上表现不足。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测的物体回归方法，利用深度学习从单幅VHR SAR图像中估算高度。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现优异（MAE约2.20米），显著优于现有方法，但在亚洲城市因高楼多样性泛化能力稍弱。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单幅VHR SAR图像建筑物高度估算中具有强大的跨城市和跨大陆泛化潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯配准的框架，用于重建无姿态稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合配准模块实现高精度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，且前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式，难以扩展更多视图。

Method: 使用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算MW₂距离作为对齐度量，并设计联合配准模块整合MW₂距离、光度一致性和深度几何。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真的局部高斯配准，精确估计相机姿态并生成高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的高斯表示和联合配准，有效解决了稀疏视图重建的挑战。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频重建动态人-物交互的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或动态主体完全可见，在遮挡情况下性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断部分遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文增强视频序列的一致性。

Result: 在挑战性单目视频上验证，显示处理遮挡和时间稳定性优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 无模板策略适应多变条件，显著提升动态场景中细节恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应扩散去噪平滑方法，用于验证视觉模型对抗对抗样本的预测，并适应输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过重新解释引导去噪扩散模型为一系列自适应高斯差分隐私机制，研究其端到端鲁棒性。

Method: 将引导去噪过程视为自适应GDP机制序列，通过GDP隐私过滤器分析其鲁棒性。

Result: 在特定引导策略下，ImageNet上的认证准确率和标准准确率均有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了自适应随机平滑分析，提供了可证明的认证。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

*Jareen Anjom,Rashik Iram Chowdhury,Tarbia Hasan,Md. Ishan Arefin Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的新型警报系统，帮助视障人士在城市中避开障碍物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国城市中视障人士因道路障碍物频繁受伤，亟需一种实时警报系统。

Method: 结合迁移学习的深度估计和物体检测模型，并通过量化技术优化模型。

Result: 实现了轻量级实时模型，mAP50为0.801。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效帮助视障人士安全出行。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [14] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分辨率鲁棒的HNOSeg-XS架构，通过傅里叶神经算子解决医学图像分割中CNN和Transformer的局限性，实现了高效、低参数和高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中存在计算成本高、内存占用大或输入分辨率受限的问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用可学习的偏微分方程建模图像分割，通过Hartley变换替代傅里叶变换，提出HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，HNOSeg-XS表现出色，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种高效、分辨率鲁棒的解决方案，优于传统CNN和Transformer模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Motivation: 解决StarDist-3D在实例参数化维度与体素分辨率之间的耦合问题，并避免上采样时的体素化伪影。

Method: 修改StarDist-3D架构，使用双三次贝塞尔三角形表示封闭表面，支持高分辨率预测。

Result: 在生物医学图像数据集上，SurfDist表现优于StarDist-3D，实例参数化更紧凑。

Conclusion: SurfDist证明可学习可解释的实例表面模型，同时有效处理实例成员关系。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中缺乏客观测量运动功能的方法，限制了生物力学测量的广泛应用，PBL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了PBL，包括云支持的智能手机应用和新算法，用于数据收集和生物力学模型拟合，并在多种临床场景中验证。

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且对临床差异敏感，与患者报告结果（如mJOA评分）相关。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了一种可扩展、低负担的生物力学测量工具，支持智能手机视频在运动障碍监测中的应用。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的SAR目标检测方法CR-Net，通过结合结构先验和证据学习理论，解决了跨分辨率检测中的域适应问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SAR分辨率的提高，散射特性的差异增大，导致目标检测模型的泛化能力下降。域适应技术虽能部分解决问题，但分辨率差异带来的特征适应和语义传播不可靠问题仍存在。

Method: CR-Net结合了结构诱导的层次特征适应（SHFA）和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA）模块，前者实现结构感知的特征适应，后者通过安全邻接集提升语义对齐的可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提升判别能力，有效解决了跨分辨率SAR目标检测中的域适应挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

TL;DR: M2DAO-Talker提出了一种统一的三步框架（视频预处理、运动表示、渲染重建），通过多粒度运动解耦和交替优化，解决了现有3D方法在音频驱动说话头生成中的渲染伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法在音频驱动说话头生成中存在运动模糊、时间抖动和局部穿透等渲染伪影，限制了生成质量。

Method: 提出M2DAO-Talker框架，包括视频预处理、多粒度运动解耦（独立建模非刚性和刚性运动）和交替优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，M2DAO-Talker在生成质量和视频真实感上优于TalkingGaussian，PSNR提升2.43 dB，用户评价真实感提升0.64，推理速度达150 FPS。

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过统一框架和优化策略，显著提升了说话头生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Method: 使用卷积Siamese网络，通过最小化相似对的欧氏距离和最大化不相似对的距离，训练网络在特征空间中分组相似观测。

Result: 在40名志愿者的数据集上实验，取得了令人满意的识别结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为颅骨与人脸跨域识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得显著进展，但模型大且不透明限制了临床采用。

Method: 引入可解释性引导的剪枝框架，选择性保留每层最相关部分，实现目标压缩。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准上实现高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 为医疗场景中的轻量级、可解释模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Motivation: 传统生成CBM依赖辅助视觉线索，损害了可解释性和组合性。

Method: 提出CoCo-Bot模型，基于扩散能量函数，支持后处理干预（如概念组合和否定）。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ数据集上实验表明，CoCo-Bot在保持视觉质量的同时提升了概念级可控性和可解释性。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过显式概念传输信息，解决了传统CBM的局限性，具有更高的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Result: 在四类癌症基准测试中表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且稳健的基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Result: MRAG在实验中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗扰动注入，显著提升了隐写图像的隐蔽性和还原能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cycle Context Verification (CCV)的新框架，用于提升基于上下文学习（ICL）的医学图像分割性能，通过自验证预测和优化上下文对齐来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学图像分割中，上下文学习（ICL）的性能高度依赖于查询图像与上下文图像-掩码对的对齐，而临床场景中标注数据稀缺且难以选择最优上下文对，导致性能受限。

Method: CCV采用循环验证框架，首先生成查询图像的分割掩码，随后交换查询与上下文对的角色以验证预测准确性，并通过动态提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，CCV优于现有方法，显著提升了基于ICL的分割性能。

Conclusion: CCV通过自验证和动态优化上下文对齐，为通用医学图像分割提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在交通场景解读中的应用潜力，尤其是针对老年驾驶员的评估需求。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，评估模型在交通密度、交叉口能见度和停车标志识别任务中的表现，以人工标注为参考标准。

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，多提示策略下交叉口能见度召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%，交通密度一致性从53.5%增至67.6%。停车标志检测精度高（86.3%），但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在提示设计优化后有望成为驾驶风险评估的辅助工具，未来需扩展数据集和模型架构以提升性能。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将低光增强与视觉理解分开处理，前者依赖物理或几何先验，后者受限于标注数据不足，缺乏通用性和扩展性。

Method: 提出GEFU框架，利用预训练生成扩散模型优化图像，并引入语义一致性无监督微调（SCUF），包括光照感知图像提示和循环注意力适配器。

Result: 在图像质量和GEFU任务（分类、检测、语义分割）中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU框架通过统一增强与理解，显著提升了低光视觉任务的通用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

TL;DR: CoDi是一个两阶段框架，通过身份传输和身份细化，在保持主题一致性的同时实现姿势多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持主题一致性时牺牲了姿势和布局多样性，限制了视觉叙事的表达。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：身份传输（IT）和身份细化（IR），分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CoDi在视觉感知和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

TL;DR: PanMatch是一种通用的基础模型，用于鲁棒的对应匹配，通过统一的2D位移估计框架支持多任务，无需特定任务架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定架构和领域微调，PanMatch旨在通过统一框架实现多任务集成和泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用大型视觉模型的特征提取和转换管道，预训练跨域数据集。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在异常场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了通用性和鲁棒性，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Method: 提出三阶段框架SHC：1) 分类网络识别语义相似性；2) 优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3) 深度哈希网络训练生成二进制哈希码。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心有效保留语义结构，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP提出了一种新的条件提示学习方法，通过多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，并结合视觉条件提示和多提示融合机制，提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有提示学习方法在类嵌入分布建模不足和跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，引入注意力互导模块生成视觉条件提示，并通过多提示融合机制整合不同提示。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过多模态条件提示生成和融合机制，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和多模态任务性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别和补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力。现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整物体。

Method: 开发空间对比学习追踪实例的栅格化，增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索引导3D生成模型。

Result: 在真实和合成场景中，方法实现了高分解精度，并生成几何准确、视觉完整的物体。

Conclusion: InstaScene为复杂场景的3D感知提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了分解和重建能力。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RALU的训练免费框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大阻碍实际应用，现有方法主要优化时间维度，缺乏空间维度的加速。

Method: RALU通过三个阶段实现加速：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，并结合噪声时间步重调度稳定生成。

Result: 在FLUX上实现7倍加速，Stable Diffusion 3上3倍加速，图像质量几乎无损，且可与现有时间加速方法互补。

Conclusion: RALU为扩散变换器提供了一种高效的空间维度加速方案，显著提升推理效率且不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景中实现了更真实和一致的修复效果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok为图像分词提供了高效且语义保真的解决方案，代码将公开以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习在3D重建中展现出巨大潜力，但未来仍需解决模型精度、可扩展性及动态场景处理等挑战。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Motivation: 现有文档识别方法忽视了文档类型特定的结构属性，导致对复杂或低频文档类型的识别效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种设计结构特定归纳偏置的方法，并基于Transformer架构实现了端到端的文档识别系统。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单音谱、形状图和简化工程图纸等复杂文档类型上表现优异，并首次实现了工程图纸的端到端转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来文档基础模型的设计提供了统一框架，尤其适用于非标准文档类型的识别。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be

scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RadiomicsRetrieval的3D医学图像检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持基于形状、位置或部分特征的灵活查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 使用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，同时引入解剖位置嵌入（APE）丰富表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上的实验表明，放射组学特征显著提高了检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供了全局解剖上下文。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持多样化临床场景，有望提升诊断、治疗规划和大规模医学影像研究的效率。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2在对象分割任务中表现优异，成为视觉对象跟踪的最新标杆。本文提出了一种基于强化学习的方法优化其内存更新，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过手工规则更新内存，难以有效处理干扰、遮挡和对象运动。本文探索强化学习作为替代方案，以优化内存控制。

Method: 将内存控制建模为序列决策问题，使用强化学习优化内存更新策略，并在每个视频上训练单独的代理。

Result: 在过拟合设置下，该方法相对SAM 2的性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习在内存控制中具有巨大潜力，是手工规则的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像翻译方法DA-KPN，通过轻量级翻译函数和语义匹配保证，解决了GAN方法在语义分割中的噪声标签问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界数据标注困难，语义分割依赖合成数据集训练，但现有GAN方法无法保证语义匹配，影响性能。

Method: DA-KPN通过估计像素级输入变换参数，结合多尺度判别器确保翻译结果的真实性。

Result: 在合成到真实数据集的语义分割任务中，DA-KPN优于现有GAN方法，并在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN通过语义匹配保证和轻量级设计，有效提升了低数据条件下的语义分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

TL;DR: DISC提出了一种双流范式，通过分离优化实例和场景类别，提升了3D语义场景补全的粒度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将体素作为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，而类别信息对补全结果的粒度至关重要。

Method: DISC使用类查询替代体素查询，并结合类别特定的几何和语义先验，设计专用解码模块以实现高效信息流。

Result: DISC在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准上达到SOTA性能，mIoU分别为17.35和20.55，且显著提升实例类别性能。

Conclusion: DISC通过双流优化和类别级交互，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能和实例识别能力。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy
and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal

achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA框架，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的持续测试时间适应问题，通过贝叶斯方法动态对齐视觉表示并保持预测一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续测试时间适应方法在处理时间演化分布偏移时存在三大缺陷：内存限制导致长期分布建模不足、熵置信度不可靠、静态视觉表示与动态输入不匹配。

Method: 提出BayesTTA，基于贝叶斯框架，通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构、使用GDA进行校准推理，并自监督归一化层适应。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演化分布偏移下的持续适应问题，为实际应用提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索如何通过最小化训练数据和标注工作量，高效转录手写文档。

Method: 使用两种不同标注方法的数据集（201份出生证明扫描件），对DAN进行微调。

Result: 标准化标注对日期和出生地等可标准化字段更有效，而外交标注对姓名等不可标准化字段表现更好。

Conclusion: 不同字段需采用不同标注策略以提高转录准确性。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,

automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

TL;DR: OnlineBEV提出了一种新的时序3D感知方法，通过循环结构结合BEV特征，利用MBFNet实现时序特征对齐，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多帧BEV特征结合能提升3D感知性能，但动态物体运动限制了其效果，因此需要一种更高效的时序特征对齐方法。

Method: 提出OnlineBEV方法，使用循环结构结合BEV特征，并通过MBFNet动态对齐历史与当前特征，辅以时序一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过高效的时序特征对齐，显著提升了相机3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Result: 通过扩展现有数据集和从零创建新数据集两种实验，验证了DatasetAgent构建的数据集在图像分类、目标检测和图像分割任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能够高效构建高质量的真实世界图像数据集，为计算机视觉任务提供支持。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer

model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高的分辨率和对比度，但成本高且稀缺，且易产生伪影。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以使其更广泛应用于临床。

Method: 使用141例患者数据（1.5T和3T T1加权图像配对7T T1图），分为训练、验证和测试集。模型与ResViT和ResShift对比。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM显著优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一策略。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效预测7T MP2RAGE图，优于现有技术，使7T MRI的优势更易融入临床工作流程。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，多个MLLMs表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 深度感知提示在零训练设置下有效，ByDeWay轻量、模块化且兼容黑盒MLLMs。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中存在高类间相似性、场景杂乱和模糊边界等挑战，现有对比学习框架难以应对多标签和低标签情况。

Method: 提出MoSAiC框架，结合多标签监督对比损失，优化多模态卫星图像的对比学习。

Conclusion: MoSAiC在多模态卫星图像中实现了更精细的语义解耦和更鲁棒的表示学习。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法为临床和研究提供了一种高效、可解释的肌肉分割方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP的嵌入式字幕评价指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统字幕评价指标在计算效率和资源消耗上的不足，同时保持多模态对齐能力。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩CLIP模型，设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行蒸馏，提升轻量级CLIP的多模态对齐能力。

Result: L-CLIPScore在保持与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力的同时，显著减少了计算资源和运行时间。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore作为字幕评价指标高效有效，但训练字幕模型时需与n-gram指标混合使用以避免训练失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: SGPMIL是一种基于稀疏高斯过程的概率注意力多实例学习框架，用于量化实例级注意力分数的不确定性，提高预测的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多实例学习（MIL）在仅有粗粒度标签（如数字病理学中的图像）时表现良好，但现有确定性注意力方法忽略了实例相关性的不确定性。

Method: 提出SGPMIL框架，利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力分数的后验分布，并引入特征缩放以优化训练效率和性能。

Result: 在多个数字病理学数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现出色，提高了预测的可靠性和校准性。

Conclusion: SGPMIL通过量化不确定性，显著提升了实例级预测的质量和可解释性，同时保持了袋级性能的竞争力。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在几何误差和泛化能力上优于基线方法，显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

Motivation: 现有公开数据集在场景复杂性、分辨率和多样性方面存在局限，无法满足真实场景需求。

Method: 提出RoundaboutHD数据集，包含40分钟4K分辨率视频，512辆车的标注数据，支持多任务分析。

Result: 提供了车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为真实场景的多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了高质量数据支持。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

TL;DR: Birkhoff是一种针对Segment Anything Model（SAM）的无数据压缩算法，具有高效、通用和紧凑的特点，显著提升了压缩比和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在高质量零样本分割中的优异表现，压缩这些模型成为迫切需求，以适用于更多场景。

Method: 提出Hyper-Compression算法，将高维参数向量转为低维标量，并设计HyperLinear层融合解压与矩阵乘法以加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试18种SAM模型，Birkhoff在压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异，如5.17x压缩比且性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的无数据压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体，显著提升了压缩效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉任务中训练数据不足的问题，利用STV特征的低相关性提升集成学习效果。

Method: 使用STV特征构建弱学习器集成，STV特征与总变分次梯度的非线性特征函数相关，能捕捉多尺度纹理信息。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV集成方法（AUC=0.87）优于深度学习（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79），尤其是CT图像中的精细STV尺度对PET高摄取预测效果显著。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据有限的任务中表现优异，尤其在医学影像分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Conclusion: 研究强调了深度特征提取和足够原型覆盖对高性能的重要性，模型在模式识别中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练，性能与EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan相当。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过轻量级修改和高效训练技术，实现了高性能的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上验证了方法的有效性，实现了数据压缩和高渲染质量，并在综合评分中表现最佳。

Conclusion: CLiFTs提供了一种高效、灵活的渲染方案，平衡了数据大小、渲染质量和速度。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Result: 在无情感披露的冰岛语音模型上，方法显著提升了模型的可控性。

Conclusion: 通过分析不可控变异并引入新标签，有效提升了模型的可控性和灵活性。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores
the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing
domain-specific information.

### [74] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证分析发现，越狱攻击的复杂性并未显著高于正常对话，且攻击复杂性和毒性随时间稳定，而AI防御机制在改进。研究挑战了攻防升级的叙事，指出人类创造力限制了攻击复杂性，同时警告学术披露可能破坏现有平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，理解越狱攻击的复杂性及其演变对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 研究分析了200多万条来自不同平台的真实对话，使用概率度量、词汇多样性、压缩比和认知负荷指标等多种复杂性指标。

Result: 越狱攻击的复杂性未显著高于正常对话，攻击复杂性和毒性稳定，AI防御机制在改进。复杂性分布未呈现幂律，表明攻击发展存在自然限制。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了攻防升级的叙事，指出人类创造力限制了攻击复杂性，同时警告学术披露可能破坏现有平衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域NLP任务中的能力，为其实际应用提供参考。

Method: 使用金融领域数据集对FinGPT在六项NLP任务上进行评估。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现优秀，但在推理和生成任务中表现不佳，与GPT-4和人类基准存在差距。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化以提升复杂推理能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战LLMs仅依赖表面统计数据的观点，探索其内部结构与理解能力的类比。

Method: 通过机制可解释性（MI）研究LLMs的内部结构，提出三层次理解框架：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解。

Result: LLMs展现出类似理解的能力，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应将讨论从LLMs是否理解转向其独特认知机制的研究。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Motivation: 解决迭代文本生成中模型难以高效识别和修正自身错误的问题。

Method: 利用Process Reward Model（PRM）评估生成块，根据分数动态调整掩码比例，针对性优化低分部分。

Result: 通过聚焦优化低质量部分，显著提升最终生成文本的质量。

Conclusion: R3是一种简单有效的框架，适用于任何预训练掩码文本扩散模型。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在自动化招聘系统中的表现及其与人类专家的差异。

Method: 使用控制数据集测试三种LLMs（Claude、GPT、Gemini）在不同上下文中的表现，并与三位人类招聘专家对比。

Result: LLMs在部分条件下表现显著差异，且与人类专家差异显著；GPT适应性最强，Gemini次之，Claude最弱。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下可提供可解释的模式，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎部署于自动化招聘。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

TL;DR: ETTA是一种通过线性变换识别和减弱嵌入空间中毒性敏感维度的框架，成功绕过LLM的安全对齐机制，攻击成功率达88.61%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多个领域取得成功，但其嵌入空间的中毒攻击未被充分研究，现有安全对齐机制存在漏洞。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换在嵌入空间中识别和减弱毒性敏感维度，无需微调或训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLM上测试，ETTA平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%，并能对抗安全增强模型。

Conclusion: 当前安全对齐策略存在关键漏洞，需开发嵌入感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Motivation: 受大型语言模型（LLMs）成功的启发，研究者开发了具有ICL能力的大型多模态模型（LMMs），但对多模态ICL的演示配置和可控性研究仍不充分。

Method: 通过外部实验探索演示配置策略（如样本数量、图像检索和标题分配），并通过内部实验分析LMM的注意力特征，提出基于注意力的指标。

Result: 研究发现ICEs配置策略显著影响模型性能，并揭示了LMM的典型注意力模式。此外，还探索了基于注意力的模型加速和压缩的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究为理解多模态ICL提供了双重视角，提出的分析方法和指标可广泛应用于其他大型模型研究。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

Motivation: 探究LLM政治倾向的成因及其影响，区分政治偏见与合理认知差异。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数，分析七种主流LLM的政治倾向。

Result: 多数模型优先考虑自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调进一步强化此倾向。

Conclusion: 自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映集体推理的新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

Result: AI辅助流程的候选人通过率提高20个百分点，就业概率提高5.9个百分点，但倾向于选择年轻且经验较少的候选人。

Conclusion: AI技术显著提升招聘效率，但也可能带来选择偏差，需进一步研究其长期影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在医疗领域输出中免责声明的使用情况，以确保用户意识到AI输出未经专业审核。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛查LLM和VLM输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: 免责声明在LLM和VLM输出中的比例从2022年的26.3%降至2025年的0.97%，2023年的19.6%降至2025年的1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着AI模型能力的提升，免责声明应作为安全措施，根据临床背景动态调整。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Result: SLMs在二分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），多分类任务中性能下降相似；少量样本学习对SLMs提升显著（最高14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，适合作为隐私保护工具，尤其在少量样本学习下表现优异。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLMs的复杂计算生态系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际效用、挑战和差距，以促进其更好地融入医疗实践。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的研究进展和临床需求。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图或多分辨率成像等关键功能，且临床医生对MedVQA的实用性评价较低（仅29.8%认为高度有用）。

Conclusion: 尽管MedVQA潜力巨大，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评估方法不匹配等问题，才能实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持或自动化研究过程中的消融实验设计，提升AI辅助科研的效率。

Method: 开发AblationBench基准套件，包含AuthorAblation和ReviewerAblation任务，并基于语言模型设计自动评估框架。

Result: 最佳语言模型系统仅能识别29%的原始消融实验，思维链提示优于现有代理方法。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在消融实验规划任务中仍有挑战，思维链提示是更有效的方法。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul是一个多轮LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化KV缓存恢复，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮对话中KV缓存恢复的效率问题，避免静态压缩策略导致的准确性下降。

Method: 动态选择压缩策略、预判性策略选择器、令牌级注意力相似性估计器、无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: TTFT减少1.5x-2.68x，KV缓存存储减少1.33x-2.35x，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul在高效性和准确性上优于现有方法，适用于多轮对话场景。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调、利用大语言模型从自然语言问题生成SPARQL查询的新方法，通过策略性执行查询和搜索相关IRI/字面量，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免对模型进行微调，同时适应不同规模和类型的知识图谱。

Method: 利用大语言模型探索知识图谱，策略性执行SPARQL查询并搜索相关IRI和字面量。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到零射击状态下的最佳性能，在Freebase上接近少射击方法，其他知识图谱上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在零射击和少射击场景下均表现优异，适用于多种知识图谱和基准测试。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Conclusion: 该框架为语言模型的透明和可审计使用提供了可行方案，适用于多个实际决策流程。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、与查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，减少内存负担，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中KV缓存内存占用高的问题，提高吞吐量并降低服务成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行令牌重要性评估，提出上下文校准压缩方法。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中保留一半令牌，内存负担减少63%，性能与竞争方法相当。

Conclusion: Compactor在多种任务和模型上表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限但人机交互频繁的场景（如智能手机）中，确保SLM保留LLM的共情能力至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段微调过程，结合从LLM蒸馏的共情对话数据集，并设计了四组针对性提示以优化共情蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明，经过两阶段微调和针对性提示的SLM在生成共情回应时胜率高达90%，比基础提示方法提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，为人机交互中的情感支持提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为真实性预测提供了全面且可扩展的工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调后的LLMs通过LoRA技术添加的恒定导向向量实现了意外的跨领域泛化能力，解释了OOCR现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在微调后为何能表现出超出训练分布范围的推理能力（OOCR）。

Method: 通过LoRA微调技术分析OOCR现象，并尝试直接训练导向向量验证其效果。

Result: 发现恒定导向向量足以解释OOCR现象，并在模型后门任务中验证了其普适性。

Conclusion: 揭示了微调过程中学习到的导向向量是OOCR能力的关键，对LLMs的安全可靠部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Result: 未经指导的强通用模型普遍优于平均水平；提示调整模型表现，但无组合能全面匹配年级水平学生。

Conclusion: 需开发新的训练和评估策略，并基于研究结果提供选择可行代理的指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像任务（如OCR）中表现优异，但在文档图像机器翻译（DIMT）任务中面临跨模态和跨语言的双重挑战。传统微调方法会导致模型遗忘单语能力。

Method: 提出SSR（同步自检）方法，要求模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译学习。

Result: 实验表明，SSR方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，提升了模型在OCR和DIMT任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR方法为多模态大语言模型在跨模态和跨语言任务中的平衡学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商私域渠道中，商家缺乏撰写有说服力消息的专家和工具，导致营销效果不佳。

Method: CRMAgent通过群体学习、检索与适应以及基于规则的备用模式，优化消息模板。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，提升了私域渠道的营销效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统探索如何充分发挥LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的潜力。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法的效果。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维提升LLMs性能；RLLMs自带长链思维，常规方法对其提升有限；多语言对齐方法通过延长推理长度提升LLMs多语言性能，对RLLMs效果不明显。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评估指标（如ROUGE）在英语中有效，但在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确，因此需要系统性评估。

Method: 设计了大规模评估套件，涵盖八种语言和四种类型学家族，分析指标与人类评价的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合性语言中与人类评价相关性较低，而神经网络指标表现更优；适当的分词可改善问题。

Conclusion: n-gram指标对融合性语言有限，建议更多投资于基于神经网络的评估指标。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Motivation: 语言模型容易产生事实错误的幻觉，微调高质量事实数据可能减少幻觉，但获取黄金数据成本高且可能引发更多下游幻觉。

Method: 研究微调数据的事实性与幻觉之间的关系，比较黄金数据和模型生成数据的效果，并评估基于模型内部判断的过滤策略。

Result: 微调模型认为可信的生成数据比黄金数据更有效，且基于模型内部判断过滤的生成数据能显著提升事实性。

Conclusion: 模型自身的可信判断可作为提升事实性的有效信号，适用于多个领域。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential
across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research
methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a
systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains
underexplored. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the

integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource

Motivation: 现有LLM知识编辑方法在关联事实传播中难以保持逻辑一致性。

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化能力提升30%以上，同时保持编辑可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑中实现了逻辑一致性的新最佳性能。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Motivation: 税务咨询中客户常以自然语言描述案例，LLMs有望自动化决策并减轻税务专业人员负担，但其幻觉倾向带来挑战。

Method: 实验采用微调和检索增强生成（RAG）两种方法，应用于教科书案例和实际税务咨询案例，评估LLMs的法律推理能力。

Result: LLMs能自动化常规任务并提供初步分析，但当前原型因法律领域敏感性无法完全自动化。

Conclusion: LLMs在适当配置下可支持税务专业人士，但需进一步整合结构化背景信息以处理隐性客户知识和特定上下文文档。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are

Conclusion: 结论是LLM在主题建模中并非总是最优选择，但其后校正功能具有实际价值。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

TL;DR: DocPolarBERT是一种布局感知的BERT模型，通过相对极坐标系统改进自注意力机制，无需绝对2D位置嵌入，在小规模预训练数据下实现SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档理解模型依赖绝对2D位置嵌入，可能效率不高。DocPolarBERT旨在通过相对极坐标系统优化布局感知能力，减少对大规模预训练数据的依赖。

Method: 扩展自注意力机制，采用相对极坐标系统表示文本块位置，替代传统的笛卡尔坐标系。

Conclusion: 精心设计的注意力机制可弥补预训练数据的不足，为文档理解提供高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document

We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative
polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being
pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLM在公开论证分类数据库中缺乏研究的空白，并评估其性能。

Method: 使用Args.me和UKP等数据集测试GPT、Llama、DeepSeek等模型及其推理增强变体。

Result: ChatGPT-4o在论证分类基准中表现最佳，Deepseek-R1在推理增强模型中表现最优。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM表现优异，但仍存在错误，需改进提示算法并完善数据集。

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Motivation: 研究ASR转录错误对说话人归属任务的影响，填补了此前仅关注人工转录数据的空白。

Method: 通过对比ASR转录和人工转录数据，分析转录错误对说话人归属性能的影响。

Result: ASR转录错误对说话人归属任务影响有限，且ASR转录可能优于人工转录。

Conclusion: ASR转录在说话人归属任务中表现优异，转录错误可能揭示说话人特征。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KELPS框架通过神经符号方法将非正式数学转化为多种形式语言，解决了多语言平行语料库的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在形式化非正式数学时因语料库数量和质量限制而面临的瓶颈。

Method: 提出KELPS框架，通过知识方程（KEs）将自然语言翻译为形式语言，并转换为目标语言（如Lean、Coq、Isabelle）。

Result: 在MiniF2F数据集上达到88.9%的语法准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: KELPS框架有效提升了形式化数学的准确性和效率，为多语言形式化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参数更新的动态知识图谱增强框架（KGA），通过内外聚合路径实现实时知识融合，提升大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱增强方法依赖参数微调，易导致灾难性遗忘和泛化能力下降，且无法适应实时知识更新。

Method: 设计了知识图谱引导注意力模块（KGA），包含外向聚合（动态融合外部知识）和内向聚合（过滤任务无关信号），形成闭环增强机制。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的知识融合性能。

Conclusion: KGA框架无需参数更新即可实现实时知识融合，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLMs）多为纯文本模型，忽略了软件开发中常用的视觉辅助工具（如图表和流程图），限制了代码生成的实用性和准确性。

Method: 开发了MM-Coder模型，结合视觉工作流（Visual Workflow）和文本指令，并构建了MMc-Instruct数据集进行多模态指令调优。同时提出了MMEval基准用于评估多模态代码生成。

Result: 评估显示，模型在精确捕捉视觉信息、遵循指令和高级编程知识方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: MM-Coder通过整合多模态输入，有望革新工业编程，使LLMs能够理解和实现基于文本和视觉设计的复杂规范。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Result: 实验证明该方法能改善推理结构和任务性能，且在超参数稳定性、推理效率和集成便捷性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: cache steering是一种更稳健、实用的控制生成方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Result: 在SemEval-2025 Task 8的两个子任务中均取得第一名。

Conclusion: TableReasoner通过结合LLM和编程方法，有效解决了TQA任务中的挑战，并展示了卓越的性能。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing

Motivation: 随着LLM在关键应用中的部署增加，越狱攻击成为重要问题，需有效防御机制。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈框架，防御者作为领导者制定策略，结合RRT进行对抗探索与防御。

Result: 提出的“紫色代理”能主动模拟攻击路径并预防有害输出，为分析对抗动态提供理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为缓解LLM越狱风险提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Motivation: 探索LLM在决策中的有限理性行为，超越传统完全理性假设。

Method: 在提示空间中定义均衡，通过LLM推理生成行为。

Result: 推理均衡与传统纳什均衡不同，为LLM系统提供新战略基础。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash框架为研究认知约束和战略互动提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 通过参数化的接地方法，可以在表达能力和可扩展性之间找到平衡，为神经符号推理提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

Motivation: 现有QFL框架主要针对单模态系统，难以应对现实任务中的多模态需求，因此需要开发多模态QFL方法。

Method: 采用量子纠缠进行中间融合，并提出MMA机制隔离未训练的量子电路，避免状态污染。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升了6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态QFL结合MMA机制有效解决了模态缺失问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探讨溯因推理在认识论、科学和设计中的理解差异，以及计算系统中如何实现溯因推理，特别是创造性假设的生成。

Method: 通过文献综述和分析计算系统的实现方式，分解溯因推理的组成部分。

Result: 理论和计算系统均未能有效支持创造性溯因假设的生成，计算系统多采用三段论形式。

Conclusion: 未来研究应聚焦于提升计算系统中创造性溯因推理的能力，并提出了具体方向。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

TL;DR: 提出首个统一的安全对齐框架，用于工具使用型LLM代理，通过结构化推理和沙盒强化学习应对用户和工具威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主LLM代理的工具使用能力引入了新的安全风险，需应对用户和工具两方面的威胁。

Method: 提出三模态分类法（良性、恶意、敏感），设计策略驱动决策模型，并采用定制沙盒环境进行奖励塑造。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，安全对齐代理显著提升对安全威胁的抵抗力，同时保持良性任务的高效性。

Conclusion: 安全与有效性可共同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在推理能力上有所提升，但在动态空间交互方面仍存在不足，这对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 1. 新数据管道生成294.2K高质量样本；2. 动态多任务训练策略，结合任务特定奖励。

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，尤其在通用和空间推理领域表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的数据和训练方法，M2-Reasoning-7B成功填补了MLLMs在动态空间交互上的空白。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

Motivation: 人工收集伦理需求耗时且资源密集，常被忽视，需自动化工具辅助。

Method: 在多智能体LLM中引入伦理倡导代理，根据系统描述生成伦理需求草案。

Result: 案例研究表明，该框架能捕捉大部分人工识别的伦理需求，并补充新需求，但存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推广伦理需求工程，但仍需人工反馈以确保可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言输入与形式逻辑表示之间的差距，实现模块化推理和明确约束。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLM）分两阶段处理：高层任务抽象生成结构化表示，低层生成符号化工作流或可执行程序。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，准确率显著提升（最高40%），并增强了透明度和错误追踪能力。

Conclusion: 双层框架为LLM提供了可信且系统化的推理方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断因知识表示深度不足、概念理解有限和临床推理受限而面临挑战。

Method: 采用多粒度稀疏激活、四种匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略，结合三层知识图谱（分类、临床特征、实例）。

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病QA集上，BLEU提升0.09，ROUGE提升0.05，准确率提升0.12，峰值准确率达0.89。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了信息质量、推理能力和专业表达，有望缩短罕见病患者的诊断时间。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考的生物样本记录问题，现有自动化方法未能充分利用地图信息。

Method: 采用基于网格的多模态大模型（LMM）方法，在零样本设置下视觉化空间关系。

Result: 实验显示，该方法比单模态大语言模型和现有工具更准确（平均误差约1公里）。

Conclusion: 多模态大模型在理解精细地图方面表现优异，提出了将其整合到地理参考工作流的实用框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期工程设计涉及复杂的迭代推理，现有的大型语言模型（LLM）工作流难以维持任务连续性和生成可执行模型。研究旨在评估结构化多智能体系统（MAS）是否比简单的双智能体系统（2AS）更有效。

Method: 通过设计状态图（DSG）表示需求、物理实现和物理模型，比较九角色MAS与双智能体2AS的性能，实验包括60次运行，评估JSON有效性、需求覆盖等指标。

Result: MAS在生成细粒度DSG上表现更好，但需求覆盖率低（<20%），代码兼容性平均低于50%。推理蒸馏模型能可靠标记工作流完成。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体编排提升了设计细节，但需求覆盖和代码兼容性仍是挑战，推理蒸馏LLM改善了完成率。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Motivation: 基于Leanabell-Prover-V1的改进，通过验证器反馈使模型能够自我修正推理错误，进一步提升性能。

Method: 采用验证器反馈的RL训练，结合反馈令牌掩码和简单奖励策略，优化多轮验证器交互的推理轨迹。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能分别提升了3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和RL优化，显著提升了形式化定理证明的性能。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖LLMs和MLLMs，但受限于其自然语言理解能力和高推理成本，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 设计了INoT框架，通过LLM-Read代码提示实现程序化对话推理，使自我否定和反思在LLM内部完成。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，推理成本降低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT框架在性能和成本上均优于基线方法，并展示了在多模态任务中的通用性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is
highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted

increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,
surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization
utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.
