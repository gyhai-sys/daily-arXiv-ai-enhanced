Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDNIG是一种基于U-Net架构的新型深度学习框架，用于低光图像增强，通过亮度引导和SPP模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强问题，通过亮度引导和GAN框架优化模型性能。

Method: 结合U-Net架构、亮度图（BCP）、SPP模块和Swish激活函数，使用GAN框架和复合损失函数训练。

Result: 在定量指标和视觉质量上表现优异，模型复杂度较低。

Conclusion: EDNIG适用于实际应用，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is
available at https://github.com/tranleanh/ednig.

### [3] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了视觉语言模型在非局部视觉推理任务中的表现，发现即使顶尖模型在简单感知测试中也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在测试视觉语言模型是否具备类似人类的非局部视觉推理能力，填补现有评估的空白。

Method: 设计了三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索和平滑视觉搜索），并对旗舰模型进行评估。

Result: 顶尖模型在这些任务中表现不佳，甚至接近随机准确率，远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 尽管视觉语言模型在原始视觉能力上有进步，但仍缺乏核心的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

### [4] [Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13362)
*Binbin Ji,Siddharth Agrawal,Qiance Tang,Yvonne Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLM）的空间推理能力，通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示和强化学习优化表现。发现结构化多阶段提示（SceneGraph CoT）显著提升准确性，而简单CoT可能损害性能。GRPO强化学习方法优于监督微调（SFT），尤其在泛化性和鲁棒性方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过提示策略和强化学习提升VLM的空间推理能力，解决现有方法（如简单CoT和SFT）的局限性。

Method: 采用SceneGraph CoT提示策略和Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）强化学习方法，在SAT数据集上微调模型，并在CVBench上评估。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提升空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估和OOD条件下表现优于SFT，泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和强化学习（GRPO）能有效提升VLM的空间推理能力和泛化性，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

*Atharv Goel,Mehar Khurana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用2D视觉语言模型实现无需人工标注的开放词汇3D物体检测，通过几何方法推断3D边界框，并在多种输入条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D物体检测数据集类别有限且标注成本高的问题，利用2D基础模型的丰富语义理解能力扩展至开放世界场景。

Method: 使用2D视觉语言检测器生成文本条件提案，结合SAM分割和相机几何（LiDAR或单目伪深度）回投影到3D空间，引入基于DBSCAN和Rotating Calipers的几何膨胀策略推断3D边界框。

Result: 在LiDAR和纯RGB-D输入等多种设置下实现竞争性定位性能，且无需训练支持开放词汇。

Conclusion: 展示了2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中的潜力，代码和资源已开源。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Result: 在12种模态的25个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的架构、预训练策略和多任务训练方法在多模态场景中表现出色。

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

### [9] [Butter: Frequency Consistency and Hierarchical Fusion for Autonomous Driving Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13373)
*Xiaojian Lin,Wenxin Zhang,Yuchu Jiang,Wangyu Wu,Yiran Guo,Kangxu Wang,Zongzheng Zhang,Guijin Wang,Lei Jin,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Butter是一种新型目标检测框架，通过频率自适应特征一致性增强和渐进式层次特征融合网络，提升了多尺度特征表示能力，显著提高了检测精度并降低了模型复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构（如YOLO和DETR）在多尺度特征一致性和计算效率平衡方面存在不足，Butter旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Butter引入了频率自适应特征一致性增强组件（FAFCE）和渐进式层次特征融合网络模块（PHFFNet），分别优化特征一致性和层次特征学习。

Result: 在BDD100K、KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上的实验表明，Butter在检测精度和模型复杂度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Butter通过层次特征优化，在实时自动驾驶场景中实现了精度、可部署性和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,
facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving
community.

### [10] [Smart Routing for Multimodal Video Retrieval: When to Search What](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13374)
*Kevin Dela Rosa*

TL;DR: ModaRoute是一个基于LLM的多模态视频检索路由系统，通过动态选择最优模态减少计算开销41%，同时保持60.9%的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集文本标注虽然能达到75.9%的召回率，但需要昂贵的离线处理且会遗漏34%的视觉信息（如场景文本）。

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图，动态路由查询到ASR、OCR和视觉索引，平均每查询使用1.78种模态，而非全量3.0模态搜索。

Result: 在180万视频片段上的评估显示，智能路由减少了基础设施成本，同时保持实际部署的竞争力。

Conclusion: ModaRoute为多模态检索系统提供了一种实用的扩展方案，平衡了计算开销与检索效果。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Result: 研究总结了实际检测环境中的关键挑战，并指出了新兴趋势，为该领域提供了全面的视角。

Conclusion: 开放集缺陷检测技术正成为主流，但仍需解决实际应用中的挑战，未来发展趋势值得关注。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

### [12] [Using Multiple Input Modalities Can Improve Data-Efficiency and O.O.D. Generalization for ML with Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13385)
*Arjun Rao,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在卫星图像机器学习（SatML）任务中，结合其他地理数据层是否能提升模型性能，发现多模态输入在数据有限和跨区域场景中尤为有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SatML模型主要依赖光学图像输入，但其他地理数据层（如高程模型、环境传感器数据）可能提供额外价值，研究旨在验证这一点。

Method: 通过为SatML基准任务生成增强数据集（附加地理数据层），评估多模态输入对分类、回归和分割任务的影响。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升模型性能，尤其在数据有限和跨区域场景中。硬编码融合策略优于学习策略。

Conclusion: 多模态输入能提高SatML的数据效率和泛化能力，硬编码融合策略值得进一步研究。

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Result: 在先进流匹配模型上的实验表明，该方法能有效擦除概念且不损害模型整体性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全、负责任的生成模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

*Chihiro Noguchi,Takaki Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用低成本二进制占用数据增强3D语义占用预测的框架，通过分解预测过程为二进制和语义模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义占用预测需要昂贵的LiDAR标注数据，而低成本的大规模二进制占用数据潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出了一种基于二进制占用的框架，将预测分解为二进制和语义占用模块，有效利用二进制数据。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在预训练和自动标注任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本增强3D语义占用预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

### [15] [InSyn: Modeling Complex Interactions for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397)
*Kaiyuan Zhai,Juan Chen,Chao Wang,Zeyi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型InSyn，通过显式捕捉多样化的行人交互模式（如同步行走或冲突行为）和方向敏感的社交行为，显著提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性。同时，引入了一种名为SSOS的训练策略，有效减少了时间序列预测中的初始步误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人轨迹预测在智能应用中至关重要，但现有方法主要依赖相对位置建模交互，忽略了特定交互模式（如配对行走或冲突行为），导致在拥挤场景中预测准确性受限。

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样化的交互模式和方向敏感的社交行为；引入SSOS训练策略，缓解时间序列预测中的初始步发散问题。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上的实验表明，InSyn显著优于现有基线模型，尤其是在高密度场景中；SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低了约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn通过显式建模多样化交互模式和方向敏感行为，结合SSOS策略，显著提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，尤其是在复杂拥挤场景中。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Result: MADI显著提升了扩散模型的编辑性、组合性和可控性，特别是在密集提示训练下表现更优。

Conclusion: MADI为扩散模型在通用、上下文生成架构中的集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Result: 生成了一个包含1,400分钟数据的多模态数据集，记录了驾驶员状态的渐变而非离散标签。

Conclusion: 该数据集为 drowsiness 检测研究提供了更丰富的多模态数据支持，未来可公开获取。

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

TL;DR: AortaDiff是一种基于扩散的框架，直接从CT/MRI体积生成平滑的主动脉表面，解决了现有方法依赖大量标注数据和手动干预的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的3D主动脉构建对临床诊断、术前规划和CFD模拟至关重要，但现有方法依赖大量标注数据和手动干预，难以生成适合CFD分析的几何一致表面。

Method: AortaDiff采用体积引导的条件扩散模型生成主动脉中心线，并自动提取血管轮廓，最终拟合为平滑的3D表面。

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff即使在训练数据有限的情况下也能有效构建正常和病理主动脉网格，包括动脉瘤或缩窄病例。

Conclusion: AortaDiff提供了一种端到端工作流，减少了对标注数据的依赖，并能生成高质量的CFD兼容网格，适用于心血管研究。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注视觉问答（VQA），但缺乏对视觉蕴含能力的评估，尤其是在拥挤场景中。

Method: 提出COREVQA基准，包含5608对图像和合成生成的真/假陈述对，基于CrowdHuman数据集。

Result: 顶级VLM准确率低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%），显示模型在拥挤场景中的推理能力不足。

Conclusion: COREVQA揭示了VLM在视觉蕴含推理上的关键局限性，尤其是在复杂场景中。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI和合成媒体的快速发展，区分AI生成图像与真实图像对防止错误信息和确保数字真实性至关重要。传统水印技术易受对抗攻击影响，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: IConMark通过在AI生成图像中嵌入有意义的语义属性，而非传统噪声或扰动，实现可解释且抗对抗攻击的水印。还提出了结合StegaStamp和TrustMark的混合方法（IConMark+SS和IConMark+TM）。

Result: IConMark及其变体在水印检测的AUROC得分上分别比最佳基线高出10.8%、14.5%和15.9%，且在图像质量保持上表现优异。

Conclusion: IConMark为可解释水印技术提供了有效解决方案，其鲁棒性和可读性使其在对抗攻击和图像增强中表现突出，并可与其他水印技术结合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

Motivation: 肩部骨折在急诊和高流量临床环境中常被漏诊，AI工具可帮助早期检测并减少诊断延误。

Method: 使用10,000张标注的肩部X光片，开发了多模型深度学习系统，包括Faster R-CNN、EfficientDet和RF-DETR，并应用了多种集成技术。

Result: NMW集成方法实现了95.5%的准确率和0.9610的F1分数，优于所有单一模型。

Conclusion: 基于集成的AI系统能可靠检测肩部骨折，适合实时诊断工作流，但仅限于二元骨折检测。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

Motivation: 利用CORONA影像解决因环境变迁导致考古遗址消失的问题。

Result: 检测精度显著提升（IoU>85%，准确率90%），并发现四个新遗址。

Conclusion: AI结合CORONA影像是研究消失考古遗址的有效方法。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测驾驶意图对提升人机共驾系统的安全性和交互效率至关重要，但现有方法难以建模复杂的时空依赖性和人类驾驶行为的不可预测性。

Method: 提出CaSTFormer，包含Reciprocal Shift Fusion（RSF）机制、Causal Pattern Extraction（CPE）模块和Feature Synthesis Network（FSN），分别用于特征对齐、消除虚假相关性和合成纯净表征。

Result: 在Brain4Cars数据集上实现最先进性能，有效捕捉复杂因果时空依赖。

Conclusion: CaSTFormer显著提升了驾驶意图预测的准确性和透明度。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于摄影测量点云不确定性量化的框架，通过关联误差协方差矩阵解决MVS阶段的不确定性估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄影测量点云的精度高度依赖场景，且MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，需要一种自监督且符合误差传播路径的方法。

Method: 采用自校准方法，利用MVS阶段的可靠n视点（n≥6）和匹配成本值回归视差不确定性。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为摄影测量点云提供了稳健且可验证的不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着2D材料在纳米电子学中的广泛应用，需要高效的电气表征技术，传统AFM方法速度慢，难以满足大规模生产需求。

Method: 提出SparseC-AFM模型，利用稀疏扫描数据快速重建导电性图，支持多种扫描模式和实验条件。

Result: 相比传统方法，SparseC-AFM将采集时间减少11倍以上，且预测结果与高分辨率数据电气性质高度一致。

Conclusion: SparseC-AFM为AI辅助2D材料表征从实验室研究向工业应用迈出重要一步。

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that

By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are

performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF方法有效解决了噪声点云下的表面重建问题，为3D神经场提供了一种新的去噪和优化思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

<details>

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无监督去模糊提供了有效解决方案，并展示了扩散模型在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性方法生成的SR图像模糊且感知质量差，因此需要一种能生成清晰、高保真SR图像的方法。

Method: 采用扩散模型结合随机采样器（高阶ODE）和一步扩散（知识蒸馏）来提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将运行时间降至基线的1.6%，同时保持图像失真和感知质量的SR质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和SR质量之间取得了平衡，为图像超分辨率提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型缺乏细粒度对象级理解的链式推理能力，需要结构化注释支持逐步推理。

Method: 提出CoTasks框架，将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、时空关系提取等四个基础任务，并嵌入中间推理步骤。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型性能显著提升，尤其在因果、时序和描述性子类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为一种结构化链式推理监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从移动相机视角分离动态和静态物体对3D重建、自主导航和场景理解至关重要，但现有方法依赖光流，难以处理复杂场景。

Method: FoELS结合光流和纹理信息，通过计算扩展焦点（FoE）及其异常值生成初始运动概率，再与分割先验融合得到最终运动概率。

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频中表现优异，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: FoELS能有效处理复杂场景、旋转相机运动和平行运动，性能优越。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF和SMPL的混合模型生成真实感头像时，由于变形计算成本高导致推理速度慢。EPSilon旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两种采样策略：空射线省略（ERO）和空区间省略（EIO），以减少无效采样点。

Result: EPSilon仅需3.9%的采样点，推理速度快20倍，训练收敛快4倍，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效采样策略显著提升了混合模型的性能，为3D头像生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Conclusion: PW-FNet通过结合小波和傅里叶变换，为图像恢复提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB图像在3D手-物交互任务中存在几何模糊和严重遮挡，传统方法难以精确估计姿态。

Method: 采用MAE的掩码重建策略，引入区域特定掩码比例分配和骨架驱动掩码引导，结合掩码SDF多模态学习。

Result: 实验表明，MaskHOI显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性学习，有效提升了3D手-物交互姿态估计性能。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 现实中的V2X协同感知系统因传感器配置异构性导致特征融合和感知可靠性问题，需要一种统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出HeCoFuse框架，采用分层融合机制（通道和空间注意力）和自适应空间分辨率调整模块，结合动态融合类型调整策略。

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在多种传感器配置下表现优异，3D mAP最高达43.38%，并在CVPR 2025 DriveX挑战赛中取得第一名。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为当前TUM-Traf V2X数据集上的最先进方法。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Motivation: 结构健康监测需求增长，需要高精度运动测量技术。现有视觉方法在亚像素级测量中精度不足或参数调优复杂。

Method: 开发了一种基于高斯核的运动测量方法，通过跟踪高斯核位置提取帧间运动，引入运动一致性和超分辨率约束以提高精度和鲁棒性。

Result: 数值和实验验证表明，该方法无需针对不同样本定制参数即可实现高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高精度、低成本的视觉运动测量解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Conclusion: Diffusion-FSCIL通过生成模型的能力有效解决了FSCIL问题，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Motivation: 现有的GOSPA和T-GOSPA度量在评估MOT算法时缺乏灵活性，无法对不同错误类型（如漏检和误检）施加不同惩罚，且定位误差成本必须对称。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出两种准度量：一种扩展GOSPA度量，衡量对象集的差异；另一种扩展T-GOSPA度量，衡量轨迹集的差异。这些准度量允许对漏检和误检施加不同惩罚，且定位误差成本无需对称。

Result: 通过仿真实验，使用T-GOSPA准度量评估了几种贝叶斯MOT算法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的准度量在MOT评估中更具灵活性，适用于特定应用场景，能够更准确地反映算法性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以准确捕捉HSI的高频细节，需要一种更有效的方法来提升重建质量。

Method: 通过扩散模型隐式学习光谱扩散先验（SDP），并设计光谱先验注入模块（SPIM）动态引导模型恢复HSI细节。

Result: 在MST和BISRNet两种HSI方法上，性能优于现有网络约0.5 dB。

Conclusion: SDP和SPIM的结合显著提升了HSI重建的细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在处理诗歌等复杂、抽象语言时表现不佳，信息丢失严重。

Method: 采用多阶段提示优化循环和改进的自注意力机制，生成多张一致图像以传达诗歌含义。

Result: 通过人类和定量评估验证了方法的有效性，生成图像能更好地捕捉诗歌信息。

Conclusion: PoemTale Diffusion为诗歌到图像生成提供了新视角，并推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Motivation: 磁共振血流成像的低时空分辨率和信噪比限制了其诊断价值，需要一种方法提升分辨率和预测精度。

Method: 提出LoFNO架构，整合拉普拉斯特征向量作为几何先验，结合增强深度超分辨率网络（EDSR）层，实现去噪和时空上采样。

Result: LoFNO在速度和WSS预测上优于插值和其他深度学习方法，提升了脑血管诊断的精确性。

Conclusion: LoFNO通过几何先验和神经算子框架的结合，显著提升了血流数据的时空分辨率和诊断能力。

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

Conclusion: CF-SSC框架通过时空建模和未来帧预测，有效解决了单目SSC的局限性，提升了场景补全能力。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

Motivation: 理解StyleGAN生成器的工作原理及其潜在滥用风险。

Result: 权重修剪可减少计算需求，潜在向量能精确控制生成图像特征。

Conclusion: StyleGAN技术具有学术价值，但也存在被滥用于伪造身份的风险。

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that
enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal
modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To
address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for
future Video-LMM development.

Motivation: 解决VLMs在处理知识冲突时可能产生的幻觉和不可靠响应问题，探索其内部机制。

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，通过logit检查定位关键头部，并修改这些头部以引导模型行为。

Result: 发现一小部分头部控制冲突，修改后可引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入；这些头部的注意力定位优于基于梯度的归因方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs处理知识冲突的机制，为模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升了视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.

Conclusion: PE与经典图像描述符的结合为图像分类提供了一种轻量级、可解释的替代方案，展示了熵特征在计算机视觉中的潜力。

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Result: ClearVQA为评估VLM交互解决模糊问题的能力提供了标准。

Conclusion: ClearVQA填补了交互式澄清研究的空白，为未来VLM设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Conclusion: 自动化流程显著提升了训练数据的规模和质量，推动了图像编辑助手的研究和应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

Result: 在定量和定性评估中达到最先进性能，展示了鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: DynFaceRestore通过动态策略成功解决了盲脸恢复中的保真度与质量平衡问题。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

*Weiqi Yang,Xu Zhou,Jingfu Guan,Hao Du,Tianyu Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAM-MAMBA框架通过Mamba模型和GRAM矩阵优化多模态融合，解决复杂性和模态缺失问题，实验验证其高效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合在IoT感知中至关重要，但现有系统面临模型复杂度高、模态对齐不足和缺失数据鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 结合线性复杂度的Mamba模型和GRAM矩阵策略进行模态对齐，引入低秩自适应层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上表现优异，错误率降低且性能提升显著。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA在资源受限环境中实现了高效、鲁棒的多模态感知。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: VLA-Mark是一种视觉对齐的水印框架，通过跨模态协调嵌入可检测水印，同时保持语义保真度，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法因偏置标记选择和静态策略破坏了视觉-文本对齐，需要一种保护知识产权且不影响多模态一致性的解决方案。

Method: VLA-Mark整合多尺度视觉-文本对齐指标（局部补丁亲和性、全局语义一致性和上下文注意力模式），动态平衡水印强度与语义保留。

Result: 实验显示，VLA-Mark在PPL和BLEU上分别优于传统方法7.4%和26.6%，检测准确率达98.8% AUC，抗攻击能力达96.1%。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark在保持文本-视觉一致性的同时，为质量保护的多模态水印设定了新标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

TL;DR: SkySense V2是一个统一的多模态遥感基础模型，通过单一Transformer主干处理多种模态数据，采用自适应SSL策略和MoE模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需为每种模态训练独立主干网络，导致冗余和低效；且传统SSL方法未充分考虑遥感图像特性。

Method: 使用单一Transformer主干，结合自适应patch合并模块、可学习模态提示token和MoE模块。

Result: 在7个任务的16个数据集上评估，平均性能提升1.8分。

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性优化，显著提升了多模态遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

Motivation: 脊柱侧弯影响2-4%的青少年，传统手动测量耗时且存在观察者间差异，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 研究通过多中心回顾性评估，使用103张脊柱X光片，比较深度学习软件与两位放射科医生的测量结果。

Result: AI与放射科医生的测量误差较小（MAE约3.9度），相关性高（Pearson r约0.9），分类一致性中等（Cohen kappa 0.51-0.64）。

Conclusion: 该软件能复现专家级测量结果，可用于临床脊柱侧弯的快速评估和分类。

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

Conclusion: 量子辅助深度学习框架在大规模城市建筑分割中具有潜力。

Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban
planning, disaster response, and population mapping. Yet accurately segmenting
buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and
high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a
Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net
model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the
urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational
efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of
quantum-assisted Deep Learning frameworks for large-scale building segmentation
in urban environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth3DLane提出了一种双路径框架，结合自监督单目深度估计，无需昂贵传感器或额外深度数据，实现了高效的单目3D车道检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目3D车道检测中缺乏显式空间信息的问题，避免依赖昂贵传感器或大规模真实深度数据，并扩展至无相机标定的场景。

Method: 采用双路径框架：鸟瞰路径提取空间信息，前视路径提取语义信息，结合3D车道锚点采样特征，并预测每帧相机参数。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中表现优异，且无需真实相机参数即可应用。

Conclusion: Depth3DLane为单目3D车道检测提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

Motivation: 现有图像定制方法在实体级空间控制上表现不足，主要缺乏绑定身份与精确位置的可扩展数据集。

Method: 构建双向生成范式的合成管道以消除主题漂移，设计轻量级位置调制层解耦空间嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，PositionIC能实现精确空间控制并保持高一致性。

Conclusion: PositionIC为开放世界多实体场景下的可控高保真图像定制铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in
open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further
research.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂相机轨迹场景中表现不佳，导致相机姿态估计和3D建模的局部最优问题。

Method: 提出两种正则化方法：特征重投影正则化和基于小波的高频细节正则化。

Result: 实验表明PCR-GS在复杂相机轨迹下显著提升了3D场景建模效果。

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过共正则化解决了复杂场景中的相机姿态和3D建模问题。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Motivation: LiDAR点云特征表达能力有限，尤其是反射率属性的区分能力较弱，DepthAnything提供的密集深度先验可以弥补这一不足。

Method: 将DepthAnything预测的深度先验与原始LiDAR属性融合，提出点级特征提取模块和双路径RoI特征提取框架，并引入双向门控RoI特征融合模块。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，检测精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型的先验信息可以有效提升LiDAR-based 3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

TL;DR: TimeNeRF是一种通用的神经渲染方法，能够在任意视角和时间渲染新视图，即使输入视图较少。它结合多视角立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，实现少样本泛化，并能构建任意时间的神经辐射场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多视图采集成本高且效率低，而元宇宙等数字领域需要能够自然过渡昼夜的3D环境建模。现有NeRF技术虽能合成新视图，但在时间维度上的3D场景建模潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 结合多视角立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，构建隐式内容辐射场表示场景，并支持任意时间的神经辐射场构建，最终通过体渲染合成新视图。

Result: TimeNeRF在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化即可渲染新视图，尤其在昼夜平滑过渡的自然场景变化中表现优异。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF为时间维度的3D场景建模提供了高效解决方案，适用于元宇宙等需要动态环境的应用。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

Conclusion: DiViD通过显式静态-动态分解和多种创新设计，显著提升了视频中静态和动态信息的分离效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for

with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

Motivation: 隧道裂缝是隧道安全状态的关键指标，需要高精度和高效的分类与分割方法。

Method: 第一步使用DenseNet-169进行隧道图像分类，第二步基于DeepLabV3+进行裂缝分割，并通过可视化技术评估模型逻辑。

Conclusion: 该方法为隧道健康状态的快速准确评估提供了基础，并有助于理解深度学习模型的“黑箱”逻辑。

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of

Abstract: Accurate detection of nutrient deficiency in plant leaves is essential for
precision agriculture, enabling early intervention in fertilization, disease,
and stress management. This study presents a deep learning framework for leaf
anomaly segmentation using multispectral imaging and an enhanced YOLOv5 model
with a transformer-based attention head. The model is tailored for processing
nine-channel multispectral input and uses self-attention mechanisms to better
capture subtle, spatially-distributed symptoms. The plants in the experiments
were grown under controlled nutrient stress conditions for evaluation. We carry
out extensive experiments to benchmark the proposed model against the baseline
YOLOv5. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the baseline YOLOv5, with an average Dice score and IoU
(Intersection over Union) improvement of about 12%. In particular, this model
is effective in detecting challenging symptoms like chlorosis and pigment
accumulation. These results highlight the promise of combining multi-spectral
imaging with spectral-spatial feature learning for advancing plant phenotyping
and precision agriculture.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种情感驱动的图像编辑方法，通过数据集、模型和编辑工具实现精确的情感转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感与视觉内容结合时因情感抽象性和多样性导致的精确编辑难题。

Method: 1. 构建MoodArchive数据集；2. 开发MoodifyCLIP模型；3. 提出训练免费的Moodifier编辑模型。

Result: Moodifier在情感准确性和内容保留上优于现有方法，支持多领域应用。

Conclusion: 通过将抽象情感与具体视觉变化关联，为创意产业提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子辅助网络的超轻量级EIT图像重建框架QuantEIT，显著降低模型复杂度，无需训练数据，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT图像重建的逆问题具有病态性，传统深度学习方法参数多、效率低，亟需更高效、轻量的解决方案。

Method: 结合并行2量子比特电路生成潜在表示，通过单层线性层重建电导率，实现无监督、无训练数据的高效重建。

Result: 在模拟和真实EIT肺部成像数据上，QuantEIT仅用0.2%参数即达到或超越传统方法的精度，且抗噪性更强。

Conclusion: QuantEIT为EIT图像重建提供了一种高效、轻量的新方法，首次将量子电路引入该领域，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

TL;DR: Vision Mamba的令牌缩减技术MTR，无需训练即可显著降低计算量，性能影响小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的效率，解决直接应用ViT令牌缩减技术导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出MTR框架，基于Mamba结构感知的重要性评分，无需训练即可实现令牌缩减。

Result: MTR在Vim-B骨干上减少40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效、无需训练的令牌缩减方法，适用于多种Mamba模型。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Result: 提出的方法在性能上优于现有方法，且原型分类器也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 冻结FM在皮肤病增量学习中表现优异，支持其在医疗领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

TL;DR: 论文分析了四种人类匿名化技术对异常检测性能的影响，发现匿名化数据下检测仍可行，且性能与算法设计相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在监控视频异常检测中取得进展，但引发隐私问题，需研究匿名化技术对检测性能的影响。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用模糊、掩码、加密和虚拟替换四种匿名化技术，评估四种异常检测方法（MGFN、UR-DMU、BN-WVAD、PEL4VAD）的性能。

Result: 实验表明，匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，某些匿名化模式（如加密和掩码）甚至能提升部分模型的AUC性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法对匿名化的敏感性，并强调了隐私保护与检测效用之间的权衡，为平衡隐私与检测需求提供了基准。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一种无需训练的框架，通过结合连接增量重叠图和极线几何，在多视图中鲁棒关联检测对象，适用于嘈杂或视觉不可区分的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在对象视觉不可区分或观测噪声时失效的问题，提供一种不依赖视觉特征的鲁棒关联方法。

Method: 使用连接增量重叠图建模和极线几何，结合IQR过滤和3D反投影误差标准，去除不一致观测。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，C-DOG优于基于几何的基线方法，并在高对象密度、无视觉特征和有限相机重叠等挑战条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: C-DOG适用于实际场景中的可扩展3D重建，尤其在复杂条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决专有模型封闭性和SSL聚类方法局限性，推动透明、高性能视觉模型的发展。

Method: 使用公开数据（ImageNet-21K和ReLAION-2B子集），引入多头聚类投影器和位置解耦策略，优化特征空间。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，性能超越专有模型（如DINOv2、CLIP等）。

Conclusion: Franca为透明、高性能视觉模型设定了新标准，推动了可复现和通用基础模型的发展。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

Result: 实验显示ALP显著提升检测准确率，F1分数达0.93，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ALP为基于语言的钓鱼检测系统提供了更鲁棒、可解释和自适应的基础。

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating
adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic
Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal
capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o
and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides
LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns,
detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in
phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we
propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts.
Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection
accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis.
The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to
advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93,
surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for
more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection
systems using LLMs.

Motivation: 情感识别领域缺乏高质量、多样化的情感数据集，情感表达受个体特质、文化背景和情境影响，数据收集困难。

Method: 通过结合人口属性、文化背景和情境构建虚拟人格，指导情感表达生成。

Result: PersonaGen在多样性、连贯性和区分性上显著优于基线方法，可作为真实情感数据的替代或补充。

Conclusion: PersonaGen为情感数据生成提供了高效、可靠的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance
models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse
emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by
individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model
(LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs
layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,
coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential
as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional
datasets.

TL;DR: SAFT是一种结构感知的微调方法，通过注入图拓扑信息到预训练的大语言模型（LLM）中，显著提升了AMR到文本生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在将AMR（抽象意义表示）线性化时丢失了关键结构信息，或依赖与标准LLM不兼容的架构。SAFT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SAFT通过计算方向敏感的位置编码（基于磁拉普拉斯变换的AMR）并将其投影到LLM的嵌入空间中，无需改变模型架构。

Result: SAFT在AMR 3.0上实现了3.5 BLEU的提升，性能随图复杂度增加而增强。

Conclusion: SAFT为结构化数据与语言模型的结合提供了一种通用且有效的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

Conclusion: 基于图的方法在处理复杂上下文数据时表现出色，优于传统技术。

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a
significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using
novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and
fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19
related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are
relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of
relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based
approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into
appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）的开发以英语为中心，导致印度等多语言地区的结构性不足。PARAM-1旨在通过专注于印度语言多样性来解决这一问题。

Method: PARAM-1是一个仅解码器的文本模型，训练于印地语和英语的双语数据集，采用公平的语料分配、适应印度形态的标记化方法，并通过文化对齐的评估任务进行优化。

Result: PARAM-1既是一个通用的语言模型，也为印度中心的应用提供了稳健的基线。

Conclusion: PARAM-1展示了通过设计优先的方法实现公平基础建模的可行性，为多语言地区的语言模型开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring
the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements
that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work
has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language
models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic
modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the
sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments
with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how
specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's
implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经机器翻译中文体细微差别保留的挑战，尤其是在缺乏平行语料库的情况下。

Method: Babel包含两个核心组件：基于上下文嵌入的文体检测器和扩散式文体应用器，作为后处理模块集成到现有NMT系统中。

Result: 在五个领域实验中，Babel以88.21%的精度检测文体不一致性，文体保留提升150%，语义相似度达0.92。

Conclusion: Babel有效提升翻译的文体保真度，同时保持语义完整性和流畅性，得到人类评估的认可。

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized
cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a
significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora
for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances
stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key
components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves

TL;DR: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征控制多语言大模型（LLM）的生成语言，通过修改单个SAE特征实现高达90%的语言切换成功率，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在零样本设置下无法通过显式语言提示或微调控制多语言大模型生成目标语言的挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的SAE特征识别不同语言间的显著差异，通过修改单个SAE特征在推理阶段实现语言控制。

Result: 在Gemma-2B和Gemma-9B模型上，通过修改单个SAE特征成功实现语言切换，成功率高达90%，且语义保真度良好。

Conclusion: 稀疏特征控制是一种轻量且可解释的多语言生成控制机制，尤其在模型中后期层效果显著。

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在事实性任务中的幻觉问题，通过结合知识图谱提供结构化、可靠的外部信息。

Result: 在多个问答基准数据集和实际金融用例中，模型表现显著提升。

Conclusion: ALIGNed-LLM是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著改善语言模型的事实性。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

Motivation: 研究发现LLMs倾向于信任权威来源（如学术论文），这可能带来新的安全漏洞，因此需要验证并提出解决方案。

Method: 设计PSA方法，通过合成攻击或防御性论文内容构建对抗性提示模板，并在预定义子章节中填充有害查询作为对抗性载荷。

Result: PSA在Claude3.5-Sonnet和Deepseek-R1上分别达到97%和98%的攻击成功率，并揭示了不同模型对攻击或防御性论文的相反漏洞倾向。

Conclusion: PSA揭示了LLMs的新漏洞，为对抗性方法和安全对齐提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

Motivation: 研究LLM价值取向评估的挑战，包括探测方法的系统性比较不足，以及探测到的价值是否能反映模型在现实行为中的偏好。

Method: 通过变体提示和选项评估三种价值探测策略的鲁棒性，并设计两项任务研究价值对人口统计背景的响应性及其与模型行为的对齐程度。

Result: 所有方法在输入扰动下表现出较大方差；人口统计背景对自由文本生成影响较小；模型的价值与其在价值相关行为中的偏好相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 需更谨慎地评估LLM价值探测方法，并意识到其局限性。

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

Result: 证明了句法对象可以在函数空间中忠实表示，并展示了Merge操作的具体实现（如跨频率相位同步）。

Conclusion: 研究为句法核心计算的神经实现提供了理论支持，并揭示了Merge与算术后继函数的相似性。

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

Abstract: The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with
the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users
across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational
framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and
structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned
conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph
simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic
coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models
combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic
metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while
simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity,
ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a
computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with
practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as
chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

Conclusion: 结合时间和语义分析的框架为改进精神分裂症谱系障碍中紊乱言语的评估提供了方向。

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

Conclusion: 人类写作与机器生成文本在语言学特征上存在显著差异，新模型生成文本风格逐渐同质化。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled

instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse

Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating

Method: 提出Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC)，通过识别弱模型输出的代表性答案并评估其他响应的语义对齐程度，决定是否升级到强模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，KiC达到GPT-4 97.53%的准确率，平均减少28.81%的API成本，并在特定基准中超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: KiC是一种高效且经济的自由文本生成框架，显著提升了级联方法的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

Conclusion: LoopServe通过自适应方法有效解决了长对话中的效率问题。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

Method: 通过比较LLM生成的推荐和解释与Additive Utilitarian（ADD）聚合策略的结果，分析其相似性和差异。

Result: LLM推荐与ADD聚合相似，但解释常涉及未定义的额外标准（如多样性、相似性），且群组结构不影响推荐。标准聚合方法在大规模项目集上可能效率不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在GRS中的应用需改进解释的透明度和一致性，同时标准聚合方法可能需优化以适应更大规模数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint
decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).
In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

### [105] [PRIDE -- Parameter-Efficient Reduction of Identity Discrimination for Equality in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13743)
*Maluna Menke,Thilo Hagendorff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过参数高效微调技术（如LoRA和soft-prompt tuning）减少大型语言模型对LGBTQIA+群体的偏见，LoRA效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在训练数据中常带有性别和性取向偏见，导致输出边缘化LGBTQIA+用户，减少这种偏见至关重要。

Method: 评估了两种参数高效微调技术（LoRA和soft-prompt tuning），使用WinoQueer基准量化偏见，并在QueerNews语料库上进行微调。

Result: LoRA（<0.1%额外参数）将偏见分数降低多达50分，中立性从0%提升至36%；soft-prompt tuning效果有限。

Conclusion: LoRA能以极低计算成本显著提升公平性，建议推广社区参与的参数高效微调技术，并扩大LGBTQIA+语料库和评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中提示设计的离散组件如何影响不当内容的生成，揭示了多模态环境下模型能力的显著下降，并提出了一种提高越狱成功率的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究提示敏感性如何被利用生成不当内容，分析视觉语言模型在提示设计下的脆弱性。

Method: 分析三个关键因素对越狱成功的影响：(a)详细视觉信息，(b)对抗样本，(c)积极开头短语；提出基于内部层跳连的框架。

Result: 多模态环境下模型区分能力下降；三个因素均可独立触发越狱；少量上下文示例即可引发不当输出；跳连框架显著提高成功率。

Conclusion: VLMs存在复杂脆弱性，提示设计可被恶意利用；需进一步研究防御机制。

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的GSDMM+算法，用于短文本聚类，解决了数据稀疏性、高维度和计算效率问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短文本聚类在社交媒体时代愈发重要，但现有方法面临数据稀疏、高维和计算耗时等挑战。

Method: 提出GSDMM+算法，通过减少初始化噪声、自适应调整词权重和策略性合并簇来优化性能。

Result: 实验表明GSDMM+在效率和效果上优于经典和前沿方法。

Conclusion: GSDMM+是一种高效且有效的短文本聚类方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at https://github.com/chehaoa/VEMC.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种生成问答对（QA）的方法，用于快速提取科学文章的关键概念和贡献。第一种基于文章内容，第二种基于知识图谱（KG）。实验表明KG方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助学者快速识别和理解科学文章的主要思想和贡献。

Method: 1. 基于文章内容的方法：选择重要段落，用大语言模型（LLM）生成问题并排序，再生成答案。2. 基于知识图谱的方法：构建KG，提取关键三元组生成QA。

Result: KG方法能更有效地捕捉文章主要思想，且微调实体关系提取模型对高质量三元组提取至关重要。

Conclusion: KG方法优于纯内容方法，微调模型对科学文档的三元组提取效果显著。

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Motivation: 探索语言表达（如第一人称单数代词和负面情绪词）与心理状态的关系，特别是在中国文化背景下。

Method: 基于735个在线心理咨询会话的语料库，使用LIWC软件量化语言模式，并采用广义线性混合效应模型分析。

Result: 负面情绪词频率与抑郁和焦虑严重程度显著正相关；第一人称单数代词使用频率与心理状态无关。

Conclusion: 文化背景和会话动态对心理健康交流中的语言使用有重要影响，为中国人群的心理治疗实践提供了新见解。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and
psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling
interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular
pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735
online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect
model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both
depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior
findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage
frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the
framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and
individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to
psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence
of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health
communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to
therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究侦探小说中公平性与惊喜之间的平衡，以提升故事质量。

Method: 提出概率框架，定义公平性及设计相关指标，并应用于LLM生成的侦探故事。

Result: LLM生成的故事虽不可预测，但未能平衡惊喜与公平性，导致质量不佳。

Conclusion: 公平性与惊喜的平衡对故事质量至关重要，LLM生成的故事需进一步优化。

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

Result: 工具提供了对Transformer模型内部计算过程的直观理解。

Conclusion: InTraVisTo有助于揭示LLM的内部模式和推理过程，提升研究和应用效果。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased
greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity.
Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

Motivation: 网络安全NER领域缺乏标准化标签，导致数据集难以整合，研究旨在提高数据资源的可用性。

Method: 采用粗粒度标签统一方法，使用BiLSTM模型进行跨数据集评估，并提出多头和基于图的迁移模型。

Result: 统一数据集训练的模型泛化能力差，多头模型略有改进，基于图的迁移模型性能提升不显著。

Conclusion: 标签统一和模型改进对提升跨数据集性能效果有限，需进一步研究其他方法。

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it
challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four
cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a
coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations
using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors,
limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we
propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based
transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize
poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only
marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer
model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared

<details>

Motivation: 语码转换（CS）在自动语音识别（ASR）中因训练数据稀缺和语言相似性而面临挑战，尤其在多语言社会中普遍存在。

Method: 采用三种策略：生成合成CS数据、拼接单语音频、利用真实CS数据加语言标记，并基于Whisper模型进行微调。

Result: 结合少量合成CS数据和主导语言标记的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了加泰罗尼亚语-西班牙语CS的ASR性能，模型已开源。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

Result: 研究表明，该方法为个人和职业技能的自动化评分奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 利用LLMs提取SJT特征的新方法为解决规模化评分问题提供了可行方案，并为未来自动化评分技术的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automatically classifying text
according to political leaning and politicalness using transformer models. We
compose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these
tasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform
poorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a
diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification
and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets
with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in
and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models
and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Result: 后训练和提示方法显著提升AI说服力（分别达51%和27%），但降低了事实准确性。

Conclusion: AI的说服力提升主要依赖后训练和提示方法，但这些方法可能以牺牲事实准确性为代价。

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert
unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale
experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained
explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political
issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims.
Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

Conclusion: 偏差既是挑战也是机会，为偏置感知模型设计提供启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型在跨领域泛化中表现不足，缺乏深度领域专业知识。需要一种自底向上的方法，通过组合基础概念来获取专业知识。

Method: 利用知识图谱（KG）的结构，生成任务并训练语言模型（如QwQ-32B），形成领域特定模型（QwQ-Med-3）。

Result: QwQ-Med-3在医学领域显著优于现有推理模型，并在ICD-Bench评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: 领域特定超智能模型通过组合基础概念，可能为通用人工智能（AGI）的发展提供新方向。

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的阿拉伯语语音和文本处理方法，并基于FastConformer架构训练了两个新模型：一个专注于现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA），另一个是首个统一处理MSA和古典阿拉伯语（CA）的公共模型。MSA模型在相关数据集上达到SOTA性能，统一模型在CA带音标任务中表现优异，同时保持MSA的强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）系统开发面临语言复杂性和变体多样性挑战，现有公共模型有限且多集中于MSA，缺乏对CA等变体的关注。

Method: 提出通用方法处理阿拉伯语语音和文本，并基于FastConformer架构训练两个模型：一个针对MSA，另一个统一处理MSA和CA。

Result: MSA模型在相关数据集上达到SOTA性能；统一模型在CA带音标任务中表现优异，同时保持MSA的强性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为阿拉伯语ASR提供了通用解决方案，模型开源以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

TL;DR: RHYTHM框架利用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为时空预测器和轨迹推理器，通过分层时间标记化减少序列长度，显著提升效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在捕捉人类移动轨迹中的时空依赖关系时计算复杂度高和效率低的问题。

Method: 将轨迹分割为每日段，编码为离散标记，利用分层注意力捕捉每日和每周依赖关系，并通过冻结的LLM增强标记表示。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，准确率提升2.4%，周末提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM通过分层标记化和冻结LLM，显著提升了时空预测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for
Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions
trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical
attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially
reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with
pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability
to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By
freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational
efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%
improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in
training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了CPC-CMS框架用于文档级情感分析，通过专家知识判断计算权重，选择最佳分类模型。实验表明ALBERT在时间因素排除时表现最佳，但考虑时间消耗时无单一模型始终最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档级情感分析中如何选择最佳分类模型的问题，结合多评价标准进行综合评估。

Method: 使用CPC框架计算评价标准权重，构建加权决策矩阵，比较多种基线模型（如Naive Bayes、LSTM等）在三个社交媒体数据集上的表现。

Result: 排除时间因素时ALBERT表现最佳；考虑时间消耗时无单一模型始终最优。

Conclusion: CPC-CMS框架可推广至其他分类应用领域。

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model
Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC,
based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同LLMs在生物医学任务中的表现，为特定应用选择最优模型提供依据。

Method: 对闭源和开源LLMs在文本分类、生成、问答及多模态图像处理等任务上进行综合评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，没有单一LLM在所有任务中表现最佳，不同模型在不同任务中表现优异，开源模型在某些任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择适合特定生物医学应用的模型提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and
image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on
tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question
answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate
that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all
tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some
closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their
open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),
with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our
experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are
optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种协作理性言语行为（CRSA）框架，通过信息论扩展RSA模型，优化多轮对话中的增益函数，以解决现有方法在多轮协作场景中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在协作角色中的应用，需要其不仅能生成流畅语言，还需推理共享目标和信念。现有RSA扩展在多轮协作场景中难以扩展。

Method: 引入CRSA框架，基于信息论扩展RSA，优化多轮对话中的增益函数，考虑对话中双方私有信息及条件化生成话语。

Result: 在指称游戏和医疗领域模板化医患对话中，CRSA表现出比现有基线更一致、可解释和协作的行为。

Conclusion: CRSA为更实用和社交意识强的语言代理铺平了道路。

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared
goals and beliefs-not just generate fluent language. The Rational Speech Act
(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially
aware language agents.

TL;DR: DENSE系统通过模拟医生参考过往记录的方式，生成临床连贯且时间敏感的进展记录，填补了电子健康记录中进展记录的缺失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中进展记录严重不足，影响患者纵向叙事的完整性，需要一种方法来填补这一空白。

Method: DENSE系统采用细粒度分类和时间对齐机制，结合临床信息检索策略和大语言模型生成进展记录。

Result: 生成的记录在时间对齐比例上优于原始记录（1.089），支持下游任务如总结和预测建模。

Conclusion: DENSE为真实医疗环境中基于大语言模型的记录合成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLABA track评估了语言模型在将生物医学文献改写为通俗语言方面的表现，发现模型在准确性和完整性上接近人类水平，但在简洁性和自动评估工具方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献的专业性使其难以被患者和护理人员理解，语言模型有望解决这一问题，但需严格评估其可靠性和安全性。

Method: 通过PLABA竞赛任务（完整改写和术语替换），结合专业参考和专家手动评估，对模型表现进行多维度分析。

Result: 模型在任务1中接近人类水平，但简洁性不足；自动评估工具效果不佳；任务2中术语识别和替换仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 语言模型在生物医学文献通俗化方面有潜力，但需改进自动评估工具和模型简洁性。

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

TL;DR: GraphTrafficGPT是一种基于图的架构，用于优化LLM驱动的交通管理任务，通过并行执行和动态资源分配，显著减少令牌消耗和响应延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于链的交通管理系统（如TrafficGPT）存在顺序任务执行、高令牌使用和扩展性差的问题，无法满足复杂现实场景的需求。

Method: 提出GraphTrafficGPT，将任务及其依赖关系表示为有向图中的节点和边，引入Brain Agent分解查询并协调多个专业代理。

Result: 实验显示，GraphTrafficGPT比TrafficGPT减少50.2%令牌消耗和19.0%响应延迟，并支持多查询并行处理，效率提升23.0%。

Conclusion: GraphTrafficGPT通过图结构和并行处理显著提升了交通管理任务的效率和扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent
traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are
hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability,
making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture,
which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven
traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies
as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution
and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a
Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency
graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,
analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware
token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed
architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces
token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to
TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to
23.0% improvement in efficiency.

TL;DR: PrefPalette是一个个性化AI框架，通过分解偏好到属性维度并基于社区价值观预测偏好，显著优于GPT-4o，并提供可解释的洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好模型将人类判断视为黑箱，无法理解偏好背后的原因，PrefPalette旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多属性决策原则，通过合成训练数据隔离属性效应，并基于注意力机制动态学习社区权重。

Result: 在Reddit的45个社区中，PrefPalette预测准确率平均比GPT-4o高46.6%，并揭示了社区特定偏好。

Conclusion: PrefPalette不仅提升了偏好预测性能，还提供了透明、可解释的洞察，为更可信的个性化应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer,
but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models
typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a
framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its
preference prediction to distinct social community values in a
human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science
principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable
counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic
training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,
humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that
learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.
This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse
evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social
communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by
46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,
PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:
scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented
communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities
emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human
judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and
transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more
trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI主要建模像素和文字，但世界由实体及其关系构成。关系学习虽重要，却未广泛应用，需探索其潜力。

Method: 分析关系学习的现状，探讨其未普及的原因，并提出改进方向。

Result: 关系学习在受限关系中表现良好，但需更多研究以实现其潜力。

Conclusion: 关系学习应成为AI的核心方向，需进一步研究以推动其广泛应用。

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG系统在处理复杂法规文本时因语言和结构复杂性导致的多跳问答困难。

Method: 提出BifrostRAG，结合实体网络图和文档导航图，实现图遍历与向量语义搜索的混合检索机制。

Result: 在多跳问题数据集上，BifrostRAG的精确率、召回率和F1分数分别为92.8%、85.5%和87.3%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BifrostRAG为复杂技术文档的检索提供了可迁移的解决方案，适用于知识密集型工程领域。

Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are
essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by
the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many
compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information
across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce
BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both
linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure
(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval
mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,
enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the
structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that
BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1
score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and
graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error
analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method
over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust
knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid
retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex
technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学生在智能辅导系统中组合多步骤时因路径组合爆炸导致的错误诊断困难。

Method: 通过自动完成中间输入并根据任务解决方案策略进行诊断，设计了一个基于最终答案的错误诊断服务。

Result: 在二次方程求解数据集上，该方法能诊断29.4%的步骤，且与教师诊断结果97%一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决组合步骤诊断问题提供了有效基础，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise
task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible
paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial
explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a
combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there
are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)
solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by
automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and
diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error
diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that
provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To
validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of
unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be
diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with
a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of
these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher
diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the
cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the
approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模型追踪和约束建模的方法，用于诊断学生在多步任务中的输入，并通过实验验证其与教师诊断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合模型追踪和约束建模的优势，以更灵活地诊断学生输入，即使学生将多步合并为一步。

Method: 定义约束作为学生输入与策略步骤的共同属性，设计多步策略诊断系统，并在二次方程求解数据集上验证。

Result: 系统诊断与教师编码在所有140个学生步骤中完全一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了两种诊断范式，能够准确识别学生偏离策略的情况。

Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose
student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive
problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling
supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one
step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining
constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a
strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a
strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore
the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these
diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset
containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To
compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations
(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the
system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student
steps.

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and
health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing.
The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log
generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates
contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion,
environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal
computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to
the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本体可视化工具无法有效展示复杂本体结构，限制了用户对依赖关系和属性的理解。

Method: OntView基于DL推理器，采用“所见即所意”范式，支持GCI可视化，并提供简化视图功能（如本体摘要、TBox元素聚焦和动态分支隐藏）。

Result: OntView成功实现了直观的本体可视化，并通过开源方式提供给社区。

Conclusion: OntView为复杂本体的可视化提供了有效解决方案，填补了现有工具的空白。

Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.
OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策引擎通常选择最佳规则，而该研究旨在通过语义交互建模和修辞框架，将冲突的启发式方法融合为连贯且上下文敏感的叙述。

Method: 结合经典军事理论和现代企业战略，通过语义相互依赖的过程激活和组合多个启发式方法，灵感来自量子认知研究。

Result: 通过Meta与FTC的案例研究展示了该框架，并通过语义指标进行了初步验证。

Conclusion: 讨论了动态干扰调优等局限性和扩展方向。

Abstract: We present a hybrid architecture for agent-augmented strategic reasoning,
combining heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional
synthesis. Drawing on sources ranging from classical military theory to
contemporary corporate strategy, our model activates and composes multiple
heuristics through a process of semantic interdependence inspired by research
in quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines that select the best
rule, our system fuses conflicting heuristics into coherent and
context-sensitive narratives, guided by semantic interaction modeling and
rhetorical framing. We demonstrate the framework via a Meta vs. FTC case study,
with preliminary validation through semantic metrics. Limitations and
extensions (e.g., dynamic interference tuning) are discussed.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级框架，用于动态图中的时间链接预测，结合短期时间新近性和长期全局结构模式，显著提高了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T-GNNs在建模时间和结构依赖时计算开销高，面临可扩展性和效率挑战。

Method: EAGLE包含时间感知模块和结构感知模块，通过自适应权重机制平衡两者，无需复杂多跳消息传递。

Result: 在七个真实世界时间图上，EAGLE在性能和效率上均优于现有T-GNNs，速度提升超过50倍。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过轻量级设计有效解决了T-GNNs的效率和可扩展性问题，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with
applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation
systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex
architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer
from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.
In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates
short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE
consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most
recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware
module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence
of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an
adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on
data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop
message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant
improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal
graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance
against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,
delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果知识转移的框架，帮助多智能体强化学习（MARL）在非平稳环境中高效共享知识，减少重新训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MARL知识转移方法在非平稳环境中泛化能力差，智能体需要高成本重新训练以适应变化。

Method: 通过因果干预建模碰撞恢复策略，形成可转移的宏动作，实现零样本知识共享。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能填补随机探索与完全重新训练策略之间约一半的差距，且效果受环境复杂性和智能体目标异质性影响。

Conclusion: 因果知识转移框架为MARL在动态环境中的高效适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable
success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However,
transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary
environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer
methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly
retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge
transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal
representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the
environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive
recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention
instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect
corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while
increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative
reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent
and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by
querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]
Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were
able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully
retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of
causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment
complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成新颖且相关内容时的局限性，避免依赖领域特定启发式方法和结构化提示。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关的潜在空间创意框架，无需手工规则，可适应不同领域和任务。

Result: 初步结果显示该方法具有作为通用人机协作创意工具的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI创意生成提供了一种灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language
models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and
relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during
training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt
engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics
and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and
difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by
navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our
framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,
input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage
prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary
results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI
collaboration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADPC的新型视觉-语言因果干预框架，用于辅助诊断阿尔茨海默病（AD），通过消除混杂因素提升分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别和干预轻度认知障碍（MCI）可延缓AD进展，但现有诊断方法因数据选择偏差和变量间复杂关系存在挑战。

Method: 结合MRI、fMRI图像和LLM生成的文本数据，通过因果干预消除混杂因素，分类参与者为CN、MCI或AD。

Result: 实验表明ADPC在区分CN/MCI/AD方面表现优异，达到SOTA指标。

Conclusion: 研究展示了因果推理与多模态学习结合在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

Result: 开发了一个专门为ASP设计的非单调时间推理系统，能够直接集成和操作数值约束。

Conclusion: 为ASP范式中的复杂动态系统建模提供了逻辑基础，支持高分辨率的时间和数值推理。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric
resolution presents significant challenges for logic-based approaches like
Answer Set Programming (ASP). To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon
a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There
and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with
constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved
by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the
linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal
reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints,
enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among
others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling
complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于传统系统和前沿LLM方法，同时保持通信开销可控。

Conclusion: KROMA展示了优化技术（知识检索、提示增强和本体优化）在大规模本体匹配中的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability,
yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with
limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses
Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with
structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,
outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches
while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the
feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted
knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology
matching at scale.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are a critical part of
state-of-the-art digital health technology for diabetes management. Yet, access
to large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of
robust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible,
and robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly
available diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -
2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous
glucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected
from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with
type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support
researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes
datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with
data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood
glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through
this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction
across all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML
collection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different
prediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings
from this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust
AI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain. We provide direct

Result: 在八项任务的案例研究中，AI增强的运动在大多数场景中表现出更低的误差，且在空间准确性、姿态对齐和时间相似性上优于人工描述。

Conclusion: AI增强的提示显著减少了关节误差和时间错位，同时保持了姿态准确性，为工业任务中的运动模拟提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker
behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing
methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

Result: 九个模型中有四个表现更优，尤其是ChatGPT-4和Claude 3.5 Sonnet能生成更有效的总结。

Conclusion: LLMs可显著提升桥梁维护效率和准确性，为基础设施管理提供创新解决方案。

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,
and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing
structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and
requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this
analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities
for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in
providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for
integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted
analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,
several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the
quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different
NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.
Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed
descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and
demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine
models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of
topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models
are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of
the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more
effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to
significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an
innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and
summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and
enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

TL;DR: CUDA-L1是一个基于强化学习的自动化CUDA优化框架，显著提升了CUDA内核的性能，并在多种GPU架构上表现出优秀的可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的快速发展，对GPU计算资源的需求激增，迫切需要自动化CUDA优化策略。

Method: CUDA-L1采用强化学习框架，通过速度提升奖励信号训练模型，无需人工专业知识。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100上训练后，CUDA-L1在KernelBench的250个CUDA内核上平均提速17.7倍，峰值达449倍，并在其他GPU架构上表现优异。

Conclusion: CUDA-L1展示了强化学习在自动化CUDA优化中的潜力，有望显著提升GPU效率并缓解计算资源压力。

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the
rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for
automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show
promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low
success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an
automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:
trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250
CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the
model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,
achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,
x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable
properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns
to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers
fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious
performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that
harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can
transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer
through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain
knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning
abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated
optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU
efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.
